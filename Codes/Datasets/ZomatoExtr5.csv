Pathetic inedible food served by restaurant. The staff was disinterested in the complaints or service
Mukhwas was awesome, and pure. When I visited them a couple of months ago.

While ordering rajma chawal, they delivered Rajma curry without chawal. I cooked rice @ home and started eating with rajma and i was shocked as I found bone pieces in the curry.  Next time when i order i got Rajma without any taste. No salt no spice..  They delivered the ordered after 1 hour..  Now it's up to you to choose this restaurant or no..

Authentic cuisine   Awesome food.   Loved soups here. One of the best Thai and Asian cuisine, been here 15-20 times almost . Never disappointed .
Ordered sweet corn soup but was very pathetic and literally was tasteless had to through it  Had some thick stuff in it which was not eat able
""
Had ordered chicken Singapore chilly noodles. Good quantity , descent packing and awesome tasting food. Only complain would be about the schezwan sauce that accompanied the dish wish was too oily.
First order and it turned out to a pain in the ass ... Ordered a veg Thukpa soup and they end up sending be a Thai chicken Phek soup .. Now it‚Äôs late and I‚Äôm super hungry coz some idiot decided to mess my order .. Zomato guys say they aren‚Äôt responding to their calls now .. not ordering again from here

Good ambience and awesome music
Fly high WTC has been sort of my regular tavern. I visit here to ease out with good music. A big shout out to Prajakta for the immaculate hospitality and attentive service. Also Suraj at the bar has been a good host. Makes you repeated guest for good service
last night we were in group of friends at fly high, we got excellent service from Zahid,,, the food was good and delicious ...
Abhishek serves well . Appreciate his efforts towards customer.
They deliver pizzas ahead of my location but not my location. That's strange.
""
Pathetic pizza, it didn't even seem to be from domino's. Seemed from some local tapri. The peri peri chicken wings were also horrible.
""
We ordered online to save time and self picked up our order on the way home!! Our order was prepared on time .  All time favourite veg Mexican green wave cheese burst and garlic bread with cheese dip.  Amazing pizzas with same taste same quality and also garlic bread at dominos are awestrucking!!
""
It was a team lunch for us. So we thought to give it a try. Well, it was a good experience altogether. We had ordered mac n cheese, a well known and recommended dish from alot of my friends. Then we ordered red sauce pasta, bascillico pasta, chicken grilled pizza, iced tea- lychee and lemon grass, lemonade, well now i feel we had ordered muchü§ê so, yes it was a cool experience with klock kitchen, food is also okayish, not that grand as of their prices! Prices are much on a higher side and portion size is not enough. Can recommend.

The Klock Kitchen is owned by a pleasant couple in Building No. 8 of Commerzone IT Park. It's a fancy restaurant with decent furniture and artifacts to enjoy a wonderful meal with friends and family.  The place has a crisp menu with 2 pages in food, and 3 pages in drinks/beverages. The options touch-base all the relevant cuisines, and due to limited choices, the customer doesn't take too much time to order. I've been there a couple of times for lunch, and it was challenging for me to select as there are very few alternatives for vegetarians. I've tried Mixed Vegetable and Coriander Dimsum, and Jalapeno Balls with Homemade Salsa, Cheese Garlic Bread, and Crostinis topped with Cheese and Veggies in starters, Garden Pizza, and Spaghetti Napoli in mains, and Mint Ginger Fizz, and Mocha Frost in drinks.¬†  Apart from a few nitty-gritty, I didn't have any complaints about the food, it's delicious. The presentation is eye-catching, the staff is responsive, the service is also quick, the owners are open to taking the feedback, the pricing is proportional to the quantity and the quality, what more do you expect? Klock Kitchen is definitely worth a visit if you're near to the vicinity. Let me know in the comments section about your experience.
Fresh food not served most of the food served is drozen
No Taste at all
Very bad. 3 roti kehke 2 hi bheje full testless dalda use.dont go there or order very bad experience.
""
Testless food.no quality.Manchurian was to much burned.not good food I ask for spoon but they did not provide.bad service.I am disappointed.i will never order from this hotel
No taste, They don't care about online orders, They send me very bad quality Roti which not able to eat. Paneer also so bad, like eat rubber. Extra colour use in Paneer Handi Kolhapuri. First and last order.
""
The quality and the quantity of the food has drastically dropped. They need to work on the prices too
Amazing food.. We just loved it. it has zomato gold. affordable as well..hit the place if you are gold customer.
95 Pasta N Pizza  It was yummy and crunchy  Salsa , veggies , Dip n Crunchyness perfectly balanced  Nachos with cheese and salsaüòç . . Price: 180/-
Visited this place on 11th Aug, Staff is polite here, Ambience is nice with a television in front and music in background. But main reason to visit any restaurant is the food. I have tried a Mexican pizza which was tasteless , paneer tikka sandwich which was below average. Didn't like the food at all.
KAZAATA is known for its taste and quick delivery service..not just taste but also quality and hygiene..never dispoint you as I m regularly asking for orders at home since two years..best one among all in vishratewadi..
Orderd chicken curry homestyle and chapatis,,it was bulk order for 30 peoples party ,,chicken curry was so delicious alll the friends and families members are so happy with the taste,,chapatis were soft and made by pure aata,,lovelly ,,,recommended to my nearones.,kazaata is the best
too much oil, chicken was hard and looks stale, ....will never order from here...
What to say abt this restaurant ? This restaurant is purely known for its service and it's taste...thats why they have best feedback and highest rating among all the competitor restaurants
This restaurant is 1st choice of my friends and family when it we call for Home delivery restaurant in dhanori vishrantwadi ..cos this is the fastest delivery restaurant we have ever experienced ..not just good for delivery but also good for its food and hygiene ..we regularly orders Chinese food from kazaata..and no doubt they never fails to prove why they are the best amongst all and high rated...
We got the parcel from the outlet but didn't expect this quality from them. Chicken muglai roll was too oily that it was leaking continuously from the bottom of roll. Cheese chilli Jalapeno fries was covered with some kind of source, these was no cheese visible, I don't know what was that.
""
Ideal for a light dinner or meal
I ordered a cheese chilly manchurian roll and got god forbid some onion capsicum roll I was excited about this one as I had loved it the first time I ate it at the outlet however this one has been complete disappointment Never ordering again from here I paid a large amount for something disastrous
Nice food
"Hungry street one....!!!  Recently I was upon pune visit with friends. After visiting some places we were got hungry and this time we find veg restaurant... sorry for non-veg this time....  Warm welcome with favourite songs and Marathi style welcome by the staff. This restaurant is shifted here last year because of the renewation of the previous place only the distance from 100m.  Ambiance is perfect but space is too small. Not perfect for families because of small place. Cleanliness is good and also the staff is very kind and helpful for choosing the special menu. And also there is open place for dining in the night with perfect lighting and songs. This place is besides the road so if you are dining in the open space you will be little bit disturb it's up to you. Outside kickten is perfect here.  We were hungry so we started directly with main course ......What we had there..  **Main course**  Paneer Tikka:- Perfectly cooked one. Gravy was very tasty because of some different ""Masala""s the are adding in the gravy. It was littlebit spicy one and addition of green chilli add more taste in paneer. Different taste from different ones. Loved one with perfect taste. Must try recommended one.  DalFry:- Smells good...tasty one... Given perfectly perfection in cooking. Spices used perfectly...Added garlic gives different taste ...Add lemon and taste it.... good taste. go for it.  Tandoor Roti:- Ya it is good but there is not crunchiness in it...As usual it is good but try something different.  Jira Rice:- Good .....Perfection.....Try this with DalFry it gives perfect taste. And also added Jira gives different taste. Good try it.  Perfect restaurant in this area for veg, polite and helpful staff, affordable price, value for money, go for it recommended one for veg.....Must try restaurant... Wish to visit again....  ............‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...‚Ä¶.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  *My ratings*  Ambience 4/5 Food 5/5 Service 5/5 Value for money 5/5 Overall Rating. 4.5/5  ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
Good place to have quick lunch during office hrs. Fast service literally you can count 2 mins and dish is served To thier new space is a bit congested Decent foos taste we ordered veg maharaja and was a good dish.
I would have given 0 but the last option was 1. In the beginning they said they can‚Äôt serve Naan and when we stood up to walk out they said how many you want. Food was ok but the service was pathetic. We ordered starters, main course and everything was put on the table at the same time. When we asked bring it one by one the answer was provided as in u r lucky to get the order so fast. And the most disgusting thing was that after the order was given the waiter came with the bill and asked to pay. Now we just started eating and I hope anyone can wait for 15 mins for the customer to finish the food rather give them such an experience. I asked to wait but ended up washing my hands and they give them the card and trust me guys it ruins the mood of eating. Never coming again. Thank u for the food.
This place is some what near to out dwelling. We have been taking indian curry from this place for quite some time now. This the next to reliable option when ur hungry but not ready to cook moods. Haven‚Äôt dined there much as we normally take parcel home. My favourite of this place is the Tiranga veg which they serve  There paneer tikka masala also is ok  Leaving this we have tried their kadai paneer once and pineapple raita  We did have a onion Uttapa and manchurian once but that was kinda below average  They also serve roomali roti which is kind of prepared live in front of the guest. This place serves better Indian food than the other items they have on the menu  When ever I have been here the place has always been pretty crowded and if u going on a weekend there may be a small duration of waiting to get your seats.
Worst Ever handi dum briyani, masala rice would be better than that and the service is more worst.. Masala papad taste is only good. Assistant Manager is very rude. its pure veg but with bad experience.
I have been here and ordered from here multiple times!! The best pure veg restraunt in vishrantwadi area!!  Food quality and taste is superb . It's a fine dine restaurant and ideal place for family dine out plans!! So if your looking for a perfect place for an evening with family samruddhi is it!!  My favourites here are:  Dry machurian: delicious and crispy with appropriate mix of flavours.  Paneer kolhapuri: spicy gravy with mouth melting soft paneer is my all time favourite here.  Paneer Madira: Catchy name made me try this !! It tasted amazing in slightly brown gravey.  Cheese naans :this place serves the best of cheese naans I have ever had oozing with cheese. I can eat them without any siders too.  They serve crispy tandoori rotis exactly like I need.  Dal tadka : Dal tadka here is good too. Though I was not much happy with dal fry.  Service here is quite fast too staff is polite.

Third grade food. Smelling mendu vada. Oil used seem to be used earlier for some non veg food. Very bad smell was coming from food. Again not delivered coffee in a combo order placed.
I had ordered happy combo and i found a cockroach in the sambar.. this is ridiculous. I will never order anything from this place ever..The food taste was also disgusting. Very very dissapointed.
I order mini idly sambar and got mashed food like dalliya in the packet..i was in hurry and had time to replace so however i managed to eat ..but sadly after having half of that mashed thing which i ididnt ordered i noticed a small hair in it which was really pathetic. Please send the correct order and follow hygiene
nice taste but dosa was not hot
tomato rice is little oily..I think it need to be less

They brew their own beer and they give you samples to select from ngl, they all were simply amazing that I couldn't choose one for myself! The food here is a bit costly but the taste is quite good
After an entire day, that was nothing but misery, I came across this place that I'd been meaning to go to for so long. I went in alone for a lunch that I'd been denied for almost all day long. But it seemed like it was worth it, the lunch over here I mean. More than the food, it was the beer. The brew was so smooth that I didn't even realize when the stress had evaporated off of me and put me into a state of bliss~
Must visit

Surrounded by flies and had to wait half an hour for the bill....
Although a highly rated place, my experience didn't go well with the outlet. We went on Friday evening with around 10 people and pre booking was done. Once we are settled and ready for order, we picked few items from the menu. Surprisingly, most of the items were unavailable and at last the waiter said that 50% of the menu items are unavailable. My personal opinion is that since pre booking was done, they should have told us earlier that they are facing few challenges, which might us give a chance to switch the place, as this was a professional get together. Then we kind of figured out few items which were available but I can definitely say that vegetarian food was not good at all. We had chilli potato fries, paneer pepper fry, veg exotica sizzler and none of them were uo to the mark. Special mention to sizzler, which was tasteless and no taste of burnt garlic. Non veg food was good apart from Guntur Chilli Chicken, which was required to be changed. I had few more points around mocktails and service, but would like to stop here. :-) No next time for this outlet at least!!
Arrogant n illiterate staff. Speaking English doesn't mean they are educated. Even the manager, thinks his name is rajnicunt so he is Rajnikanth.
Always wanted to come here(great reviews) and finally I got chance to visit this place. I was kind of shook to find out that there weren't enough people there and the ambience over all was a bit off putting. It was plain and quiet to my surprise. On the other hand , the food was very good, ordered the famous tempura fried prawns which didn't disappoint. It was my bday and the staff arranged this extravagant cake platter which was amazing. Thank you. Overall, the place is lavish and food was decent but it lacked something. Just wasn't that great.
Nice and cozy place to hangout. Small menu with great taste. Just a small heads up, sizzlers are a big no no.  U should go along with starters
I visited this place on Saturday night and this place was closed, they were playing loud music in the bar but it was all vacant and staff told us its closed. And the ambience at this place didn't look the way shown in pictures.
Thank you Mayur for your excellent hospitality and service.. chef‚Äôs to you I say a special congrats for maintaining good taste and flavour for over 10 years the only place besides Chillies for good ol ‚ÄòMercian favourites..
Mayur was attending us. He gave an excellent service. He gave us suggestions that suited our choice. He attended us as he know us for quite sometime. Amazing bull dog drink.  5srar to him. Food is still the same quality. Amazing performance by staff.  Apperal Shop is nice but need to have all the sizes and stock should be refreshed Enjoyed a lot. Would love to visit again.
Hard Rock has been one of my favourite place to hangout.. vibes, beverages & food!! Zak & Pravin served us with hospitality professional.. will be visiting again soon! :)
Can never forget HRC Pune as that's where my hubby proposed marriage to me, on his knees (without the ring, actually :-P ). However, my reason for this review is that apart from the delicious finger food and a veriety of drinks, HRC Pune also has the most courteous staff. My boyfriend (now hubby) & I visited HRC Pune in 2015 and with the excitement of the above-mentioned proposal, we didn't notice that there was a small mistake in the bill wherein we were charged for drinks that we didn't order. We realised the error, many hours after leaving the premises. On notifying the manager, he displayed utter cooperation and requested us to visit again so they could serve us for the same value as reimbursement wasn't possible. We revisited for another wonderful evening at HRC Pune.

Arth, which literally translates to ‚Äòmeaning‚Äô, makes perfect sense because they have redefined the meaning of food for me. A one of a kind dining experience, Arth encapsulates the essence of all that is Indian cuisine and sets it apart to a whole new bar. You will identify flavors and aromas because it‚Äôs not new to our well accustomed palettes, but it‚Äôll still amaze you because they craft it with so much precision and maximize every single detail on your plate.   Their cocktails are definitely NOT run of the mill, in fact they‚Äôre very unique and have that added desiness to them. I‚Äôd recommend the G Fashioned and Phool-tini to those who‚Äôre ready to experiment and jump out of the box. For those who prefer a fruitiness to their drink, Panchgani Sour is your drink! For coffee lovers, give Golden Malabar a shot (it was the table favorite).   Pro tip: Order one to two appetizers with your drinks, they serve a generous helping of poppadums with chutney as complements - which are delish btw.   We started our meal with Stuffed Aloo Tandoori - which was stuffed with raisins, cashews, green apple and a delicious spice mix. For mains, we called for the Beeh Dodah, a Kashmiri delicacy, which is essentially Lotus Stem cooked in aromatic spices served with Jowari roti. This was something different from the ordinary and we enjoyed it thoroughly. Next up was Smoked Paneer with Black Rice Dosa. The Paneer was stuffed and had a subtle Smokey flavoring and the Dosa was simply incredible! Best dish of the day.   We wrapped our meal with the Kesar and Gucchi Pulao - another Kashmiri item on the menu. Gucchi is a type of fungus - very similar to mushroom. The Pulao was the right balance of everything and we couldn‚Äôt have enough of it.  All this shared amongst four individuals, for a little over 4000, was completely worth it if not more! Extremely impressed and eager to come back to try their non vegetarian side of things!
Very Pathetic Service. The most slow service we came across. Though the restaurant did not have all the tables full they couldn‚Äôt attend and service us better. Need to add more staff!!!!
Just One word Awsome!!!Surely would love to visit again and try other items from their Menu.The taste of the food was too good and very different.
Arth  1st f all the name which attract me 1st ...!! I had been hre wid my bhabi for lunch ...!!! It‚Äôs good awesome food basically quality n taste was awesome  Warm n welcoming hospitality which is plus point service food n interior üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª Good experience  Good staff Good foood It was Perfect lunch for me ... üëçüèª
Nice ambience and very good place. Must visit and try their cocktails.one of the best places in Westin and very good service also. Their desserts also was must try!
Must place to visit in Pune.
Its a roof top club with best ambience. Its a less crowded place with good drinks üç∏  I would suggest you to go with a group of friends here. The music is good, the food is good, The service is okay. You‚Äôll find mostly foreigners here. No crowd build up time ..
Club was very good few years back but now days the reception guys (saurabh --i only remember his name as music was loud and i was not drunk at all when i faced this misbehavior ) behaves like they own the club they think like this is the only famous place in Pune because of arrogant employees club is loosing its value in market .My gang used to love this place because of ambiance but we stopped going there because of service pathetic customer service .food is awesome music is average and of course it open terrace so u will get fresh air.
Follow @travelling_tummiess on insta  Penthouze the roof top resturant on a busy street of Koregaon Park Pune, what makes this place true gem is the ambience and DJ. we impressed with the setup which is simple yet eligant. We ordered A square cottage cheese starter, Jalapaneo Basil Pizza and Aglio Olio Pasta. All the food items were good in taste. Though they can improve on service part.  Wednesday night was was unexpectedly cheerful and full of amazing crowd at this place. The DJ was playing full on bollywood tunes and crowed was loving it. Overall a good experience of this amazing night hub. Recommonded.  Food - 4/5 Ambience- 5/5 Service- 4/5 Music - 4/5 Overall Rating -4/5

The place has good ambiance and the service is also prompt. Have 2 sections smoking and non smoking. Was here on the weekend and it was very crowded. Had to wait for our table. Staff is well mannered and presentable . Good music to gel with the ambiance.

Amazing food, fresh beer. We ordered a Cotton Kebab, Sicilian Pizza, and the Kom Suey. Well cooked, all dente noodles, amazingly balanced seasoning, food staff, special thanks to our host Deepak Sirkar who made sure all orders were delivered at the most opportune of times. In all, amazing expericne.
Great service by sharif Shaikh great Ambience loved the service and the food was also great including the masala peanuts. Service was prompt and there was no delay in processing orders
""
I visited place with friends. Food was good and tasty.Spicy ramen soup is great, they serve it in big bowl like kadhai it is equal to full meal. I would suggest to order soup 1/2. Its tiny place but value for money.
We find this place in Kalyani nagar. Restaurant is nit so big but staff is very friendly. We ordered khau suey and Fried Chicken momos. Khau suey was very good in taste. Momos we find little oily compare to others. Overall good experience here.
Thanks for taking my feedback n arranging for a re order. Customer focused.
Great food my daughter loves the noodles here. I think what I appreciate most is that they use No MSG in their food.
""
This place is always happening and full of people. The place is very beautiful and clean. If you wanna have talks with beer or alcohol please visit here. The music is not that loud but danceable. You must visit and enjoy the ambience here. The crowd is great and many events are organised by the club very often.  Crowd build up from 8.30 PM

Inspite of a busy restaurant.. they manage to get you the order on time..best dish served in here is their kheema masala..this place is in my favorites for best served kheema masala
"Ordered mutton fry dry and the name itself mentons ""dry"" however it turned out to be a thick oily gravy with red color and chilli powder the mutton was not fresh and straight out of the freezer. Mutton generally doesn't sell well in Madina and I've learned my lesson.. no more mutton orders! Chicken leg biryani was staple and acceptable. Madina management doesn't understand what's the meaning of dry and they don't have mutton eating customers so I hope this review helps everyone to be aware and possibly the management improves and educates it's kitchen."

Ambience- Just a small shop where every order is basically a take out because there‚Äôs no seating space.  Food- 1)Red Velvet Waffle- Though I‚Äôm a fan of chocolate I thought of giving this one a try and I loved it to bits. The waffle was crunchy and moist at the same time and had a sour vanilla cream with drizzled sprinkles. I just loved it to bits and just couldn‚Äôt stop digging in. üôà  2)Nutella with whipped cream waffle- This is a heaven for chocolate lovers. Drizzled with decent amount of Nutella and topped with whipped cream it was straight up a delight.   Staff- The staff is humble and sophisticated and efficient.

Food is good, so as the ambiance .¬† there was one dish which was served earlier that was before the renovation of this place.  Dish name was chicken Bistro¬† something similar I guess. It was one of the finest dish. I miss it very much. Can you please restart serving it. Please :)  Thanks, Waseema.
I had tanoori paneer the taste was amazing and yummy.Paneer was fresh cheese garlic naan was also good the mixed veg was delicious we had paaan herbal sheesha the flavour was good the ambience is also good and attractive a very good place for live screening specially match lovers
What sterted initially as a night owls watering hole is now a full fledged family restaurant. Ever since it's inception I've been coming here mostly after hours to feast on the delicacies that are otherwise inaccessible at wee hours.
""
I ordered for Chicken lollipop and was delivered french fries
Pathetic service.
The tandoor chicken was really very good. Loved the butter nan, it was crunchy and crispy. The chicken biryani was yummy Overall the experience was nice
Worst in service and very very rude and uncooperative behaviour
Worst Service
I have been a regular delivery customer for Mughal Sarai . They have authentic North Indian flavours . The food (anything you order ) is absolutely delicious and fresh . The Palak Paneer, Dal, chicken curries , rotis , even Chinese and Italian are wonderful . The entire team of chefs are brilliant .
This place has been around since forever in NIBM Kondhwa, so much that people use it as a landmark for giving directions. (guilty!) Perfect place to hangout as it is placed at a prime location and boasts of having some amazing South Indian, mostly Udupi influenced dishes and meals.  Pros: Pure vegetarian place. Very hygienic. The service is quite quick so the staff likes it if you order without wasting much time on the menu. Competitive prices but value for money. Open till late, so it makes for a nice chai/ coffee hangout with friends. If you're a regular they might even entertain you beyond 11.30pm at the seating area outside the restaurant. Valet options available too!  Con: Not many, except that it can get very crowded¬† on the weekends and you would have to wait a while to be seated.¬†¬†  Items you must order: ‚Ä¢Wonton Hot and Sour Soup - If a non-vegetarian can enjoy these wontons, I'm sure you will too. Perfect for winter days! ‚Ä¢Cheese Chilly Toast - It might seem pricey but when the dish appears in front of you, you'll forget all about it! ‚Ä¢Cheese Masala Dosa ‚Ä¢Idli Fry ‚Ä¢Mixed Idli Wada Sambar - The other half of The Jumping Dumpling has this as his classic order :P ‚Ä¢Amul Pav Bhaji ‚Ä¢Ganga Jamuna juice - 1 by 2 ? ‚Ä¢Chickoo Milk shake ‚Ä¢Dahi Vada  If they see you enjoying the food and gulping down the sambar and chutney, they will definitely serve you more without any extra charge! :)

The place is clean and decent to visit with family. Even large crowds can have a comfortable get together here. A good option for those who prefer vegetarian. I like their Paneer butter masala and dal fry. I always like to have tea or filter coffee here. Even South Indian snacks are good here.

This place had huge diameter pizzas in a variety of flavours and toppings. We tried 'not for the faint hearted'chicken pizza and 'peppy peppers' veg pizza. The taste and quality was really good. They had homemade pizza base which was just so perfectly baked. We also had butter beer and virgin sangria, very refreshing. The location was very peaceful and cozy. It gives a very pleasant and calm feeling. A must visit!
It was my first time visit to this place. Loved the all techno big screen for the ordering. It was a bit confusing in the beginning though. The staff was helpful about it. The thin crust pizza are amazing. The pizza are actually were large. üò¨ They were cheezy and the crust was crunchy. Also they have lovely outdoor and indoor sittings

If you're looking for a break from the usual continental Indian Chinese fare, I would highly recommend Becky's Binging Bay. I have had food delivered home and both times and I have not been disappointed. I would describe the cuisine as a fusion between Mediterranean, continental, Mexican... But it's different and in a good way.  What I love is the accompaniments that come with it. Had ordered the Turkish fish kebabs which was delicious. The chicken meatball soup is excellent and is a meal by itself. The chicken peri peri was okay, batter fried and i probably won't order this again. The Mexican sante Fe again was brilliant and the rice that came with it was really good!  Happy that there are restaurants experimenting with different cuisines and happier still that the food can be delivered to my doorstep!

We had a birthday party for 30 people. Vrinda and team not only made every guest comfortable but also catered to the dietary requirements of the senior citizens in the group. All in all everyone had a lovely time thanks to the team at Becky's and were absolutely thrilled with the lunch.

"I ordered on swiggy . I must say this was the best spaghetti bolognese I have ever had. As soon I took first bite only word came out was ""Beautiful""!!! I am a fan and would try all of their menu. I hope you guys keep making such awesome food for very long time cos I don't think i will ever get enough of it."

The staff was extremely courteous and the food was mind blowing as always. Loved the Napoli and Sicilia pizza and the quattro formaggi pasta. Durga Sir even surprised us with a complimentary pizza. Delightful experience ‚ú®
Had visited this restaurant last week the kondhwa branch.... ..Quantity is less as compared to price per plate ...... I felt that amount of cheese is very less on pizza ..... overall it's ok ... one visit is recommended ....... Taste is good for pizza and pasta .... .. I did not like the taste of tomato soup .... .. They charged for water which they did not mention in advance ...... ...
#foodtasting #supriyachaubal11 Built on the principal of molecular gastronomy and already in Bangalore, Surat, Dubai cities. Akss ‚Äì India Reimagined is a place for modern Indian and North Indian Vegetarian fine dining. Location is Little Italy, Bund Garden. As you enter Little Italy, you take the stair upwards to reach Akss. The interior are modern, with comfy seating and classy decor. This restaurant served us India street food with molecular gastronomy twist however let first talk about the drinks. #Mango_Colada_Moctail : The creamy mango colada was thick, more like an amrakhand, and set the mood right, waiting for the starters coming up next. #recommended #Virgin_Bloody_Mary : Perfect‚Ä¶ a connoisseurs drink! #highlyrecommended #Pav_Bhaji_Bomb : Pavbhaji thickly pureed inside a small bun and topped with cheese. Ment to be eaten in bites sizes and when hot. #outstanding #Mini_Raj_Kachori : it was crisp crunchy on every bite, the Khatta meetha chutney, Chaat stuffings and dahi. Amalgamation was a Stellar! #highlyrecommended #Palak_Patta_Chaat : was an eye catching showmanship of the server. This molecular innovation required the palak patta to be dipped into #liquidnitrogen. Supposed to remove the oil and add crispiness. The pattas were arranged, added various condiments, dahi, mint and tamarind chutneys and garnished with pomegranate and chaat masala. Chaat ready.#Stardish #highlyhighlyrecommended #Misal_Fondue : A very attractive platting , with misal, tarri, bread squares and Farsan. Tasted great. Will be loved by misal lover‚Äôs. #Naanza: A soft foldable base, with creamy tomatoes sauce, veggies and overload with cheese. Delightful. Could do with a crisper base though. #recommended #Broccoli_Kalimari : Very soft broccoli with perfect marination. Loved it. Very innovative. #Paneer_Kurchan_Lasagne : A molecular twist to this dhaba style paneer preparation, layered between the pasta sheets. The showmanship of a flamb√©. It was scrumptious and I helped myself to one more serving. #highlyrecommended #Dal_tadka & Assorted_Roti :Dal tadka was amazing. The assorted naan - Basil naan , jalape√±os and olive naan, garlic naan and plain butter naan. Some tweets required for the naans. However very comfy food. #Chocolate_Garden : A fabulous smart dessert with lava cake, ice cream and brownies. Loved it. #Kulfi : The liquid thick kulfi milk was processed thru liquid nitrogen, the frozen ice cream pieces were then garnished with liquid kulfi milk, dry fruits and silver foil. Delicious!! #highlyrecommended. One must definitely make a visit here. The quality of the food, ambience and the modern twist is something the Little Italy group is known to excel.

Best place
Went here on a Friday afternoon. place was almost empty and I believe the staff was busy prepping for an upcoming event. Was politely asked by the waiter that orders are through app only and I obliged by promptly installing their app from Google play store. For some reason the sign in did not work for 10 mins. When pointed to the waiter, The poor man could only sum up an excuse that it takes a bit of time and he was unable to take our order.  After a frustrating 2 additional attempts i had to step out and made my way to another restaurant. A complete waste of my 30 mins.  My request to the management is to  A. improve your service and enable manual order placement. B. Forsake patrons from being an audience to soundchecks for your upcoming events.. coz seriously the music kept getting loud for no reason.
Good service ... Had Chilly chicken .... Lapeta paneer kebab and murg dum biryani ... Overall awesome food and service ...

FML Lounge located in Season's Mall is a wonderful place for hangout with friends and colleagues. Visited this place with my bestie. Ambiance is great especially the outdoor seating. Even though we had reserve the table through Zomato but the people at reception were clueless and couldn't provide a table immediately but we somehow managed to get one.  What we ordered 1. Murgh Lapeta kabab- 5/5 2. Chicken Nachos - 5/5  What we liked 1. Food especially the Nachos. It was really delicious  2. Ambiance 3. Service 4. Courteous Staff  What we didn't like Even after accepting the table booking request, they couldn't provide the table immediately.  I would definitely recommend this to others and would love to visit again
The food was good starters as well as main course. The only disappointment was we waited atleast for half an hour for main course to be served.

Great music, amazing ambience and delicious food!  The staff named Vishal is very cooperative. We had sharabi Tikka and stuff cheese paneer Tikka it was awesome , we visit again and again ,,,,
Very nice ambience. Good service by Vishal. Keep going place !!! Try Tikka ! Food is awesome.
Food was great also the world full full will get back to you 5 mins me know if you have any questions or concerns. Vishal gave a nice service.
Vishal was the best. Great service and great food The ambience was nice with live music. Overall great experience here
Food: 3.5/5 Service: 4/5 Ambiance: 3.5/5  Visited this place on Sunday afternoon with friends. As it was afternoon the place was quite empty and the service was good and prompt. we tried a few drinks here and starters. Crispy Corn was quite average is taste.¬†¬†  The ambiance is good and the place is quite big with indoor and outdoor seating options. Also, this place doesn't allow stag entry over the weekend.

VISITED LAST MONTH WITH TWO OF MY FRIENDS. ¬†Brilliant atmosphere !! Beer food and music what else shall you ask for? Lovely time. Go out and have fun!! Highly Recommended for people looking to enjoy Dinner.

Located at one of the best place as a food lover I expected a lot. Bit disappointed with number of available barbeque items. Only few of them compared to Barbeque Nation. Other buffet food items were not so much as well... Taste was just okay....Team Grand Buffet should learn from Barbeque Nation service which is always awesome. If improved over all would like to visit again
My experience at this place was good and I would rate it neutral, ambience at the place is quite eye warming but the playlist is not so good. Main couse and stratters are just fair in taste. The best part are the deserts, they have a fabulous variety of deserts, don't miss out the shahi tukda. #loveforshahitukda
Was fine starters were decent but main course was really bad there was nothing to eat in there even desert's were not loaded so better look some other place i guess.
My worst buffet experience in Pune. The food was served late, the staff was unaware of the online coupons bought, extremely limited dessert, taste was not worth we paid for. I wish I get a reimbursement for this. But not to go again n hv buffet der.  Please value d money we pay n increase the quality of your buffet.

This place is best for sea food.. they have great menu.. all the dishes have unique taste.. I completely loved food and ambience too.
Poor experience at The Coconut Tree. Average service and average food. They told us the billing computer was not working and gave us a hand written bill which turned out to be wrong after 40 minutes of their calculation. We were being grossly overcharged and refused to pay the bill and left after leaving our contact details, even then, telling the staff to correct the bill, print it and send it to us to clear. They even had the audacity of telling us the CCTV cameras were recording, in a vain attempt to force us to pay the bill. We asked them to call the cops if they thought they were so right. Obviously that didn't happen. Get your act together guys and be professional.
""
Ordered food from here. Loved it.
Nice place to eat Chinese but this time the spring onion roll which we ordered was too salty then I even I found one cockroach on my table so really don't know about the hygiene
This place has always been a dependable place for a good lunch / dinner with family and friends. Never lets you down. Good comfy ambiance and courteous staff. Had been here (yet again) on Saturday 21-Sep-2019 afternoon with family. Ordered the following items - Chicken Sweet Corn soup - Good in taste. Lots of chicken. Perfect thickness. Was loved by my kids. 4 / 5 Seafood spicy soup - This was a try out from our end, and it was an average experience. The soup had something missing, which didn't make it enjoyable. Quantity of prawn, crab and fish pieces was good. I didn't find it spicy as the name suggested. 3 / 5 Chicken Tikka - Good in taste. Perfectly marinated. Tender chicken. 4 / 5 Chicken Shanghai - Tasted awesome. Today, I found it a bit oily (photo attached). Couple of chicken pieces were chewy too. 3.5 / 5 Chicken triple schezwan - Amazing combo of gravy and rice. Super tender chicken pieces. Very fulfilling. 5 / 5 Aloo Paratha - ordered for my kid. Solved the purpose. 3 / 5 Sizzling brownie with Vanilla ice cream - This was the best part of our lunch. Super delicious and totally yummy. #recommended #musttry 5 / 5  Food - 4 / 5 Service - 4 / 5 Ambiance - 4 / 5 Overall - 4 / 5
Certainly one of the best Chinese restaurants in town, Indian food is amazing as well. I recommend them for their consistency in taste and quality.
Received a wrong order for home delivery, yet again. And no one takes responsibility for the totally wrong order delivered. This has happened four to five times now. Never gonna order again.
Good Service by Jagannath and quality food. Have eaten a number of times at this place.

Food had alive cockroach. After showing them this, The manager didn't even apologise. Won't come again
Had nice experience visiting this lovely place last night with unlocking my zomato gold on drink which was 2+2. Here they have good food and drinks options but the ambience is very beautiful. Tried below food and drinks, Cosmopolitan - perfectly blended with vodka, triple sec, cranberry juice and lemon juice The great LIT - stirred with 5 spirits with coke but did not find similar taste of the mixture as the sip had more of a rum spike Shish touk - Chicken was nicely spiced and served with pickeld veggies, hummus, tahini dip and pita bread. That's what we were expecting with shish touk. Chicken was nice but a bit spicy, tahini dip tasting more like a curd...it should have more tahina paste in it, hummus was perfectly blend....loved it, pickled veggies nice and crisped Tomato basil Bruschetta - I asked the server to have our bread nicely toasted like the actual bruschetta while ordering but didn't get it the way though the the topping had a subtle flavour of fresh basil and garlic which was good enough to enjoy it. Chocolate truffle - It was the best amongst all, it was too good, the soft and spongy layers and on top smooth chocolate sauce drizzle was the best
Been here thrice and loved every single experience. The bartenders are super courteous and the drinks are good too. The bar has a really good vibe to it and the music, in particular is fab.
""
Amazing ambience and good variety of food. However we ordered the Mama Mia chicken which was not so great. It was half cooked and hard. However the Akuri and Surmai dishes were amazing. Had a great time.
Maybe adding refried kidney beans in the nachos could help in enhancing the taste, or maybe could start using flavoured nachos if cannot add refried kidney beans.. rest everything was good. Raised the same concern at the restaurant and the GM (Mr. Joshi) made it a point to explain me the dish... felt good to see the concern shown ...
Ordered Nalli Nihari combo for home delivery. As per discription in menu it is supposed to include khameri roti, pilaf, burani raita and salad. Received only khameri roti. The taste of the so called Nalli Nihari is closer to a normal mutton dish like Rogan Josh than a Nihari. Pretty disappointed. Called up the restaurant and they did agree to replace the dish which is a nice gesture but for someone who has ordered home delivery, it's too much effort to go n return the dish. Its better if they send proper food in one go.
""
This was the first place I visited in Pune. The ambience is good with both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Some good music kept on playing in the background which made the ambience more lively. We ordered some items from their food menu along with drinks and all the dishes were very good in taste.
""
Loved the ambience. There was a slight discrepancy with the seating. But overall experience was great!
Good place to hangout on weekends. Huge Variety of alcohol. They have a good interior. Staff is friendly, service is quick. Price wise a bit on higher side and the only thing that has disappointed me is not much veg options for starters /finger food. Rest a must try place.
We have celebrated New Year twice @ urban foundry. Amazing taste when it comes to Mutton Biryani, Mutton Seekh, mocktails. The service and the crowd is also great. They value for what we paid and understand that we cannot eat all of that food all at once so they help is with amazing packed food as well.
Japanese & Thai  along with lit setting with iron grill decor. Is that it ? No way .... Gong has got a different feeling attached. I totally loved the ambience and the decor this place has got. The best low-key ambient place I‚Äôve visited in around Baner , Gong serves the Best Asian cuisine here in pune.  Along with a fancy crowd , comes Fancy food and fancy drinks. All we had was a Six Course Meal along with mesmerising mocktails presented to us .   Hot Garlic Soup was good to start with  The Sushi platter : Differently styled Sushi on a Fancy platter . We had Avocado Sushi‚Äôs Sesame sushi‚Äôs and what not.  Adding the taste of Nepal to Chinese Cuisine, we  Dumplingss here were amaaziinggg  For the main course we had , Thai curry and Basil rice : best i‚Äôve had in pune!   Food : 5/5 Ambience :6/5 Sevice : 4/5
After numerous failed attempts I finally had the opportunity to visit GONG at BHS, albeit, with a 15-20 mins waiting time. Was it worth the wait and hype? Yes it was, absolutely! The ambience has a very upmarket feel with plush interiors and cozy yet comfortable seating. The staff and the manager were welcoming and very courteous. I went with my parents and was worried if it would be too noisy / loud. It wasn't, in fact the experience was very pleasant. We opted for the unlimited buffet (served on table) and the spread included - Soups, Sushis, Dim Sums, Appetizers, Mains and Desserts with both, veg and non veg options. The Soup and California Rolls (Sushi) was underwhelming to say the least. I have had much better. The mains included steamed rice, garlic noodles and thai chicken in chilly basil sauce. The chicken had a nice Thai flavor with just the right amount of spice added by green and red chillies. Went very well with steamed rice. The show stealers however, were the chicken appetizers (I think it was crispy honey chilly chicken) and the dim sums. Top stuff! The kiwi pastry served as part of the desserts was one of the best I have had in a long time. They also served vanilla ice cream with chocolate brownies which was like every other I have had. All in all I had a delightful experience at GONG. Would love to visit again and try their ala carte spread.
Want to try Sushi or Asian or Thai food? Then this place is the end of your search.  Had been to this place a few days back. I was totally mesmerized with the ambience. They have installed bamboo like structures inside the restaurant to enhance its beauty. During night time, the dim light would give you a soothing atmosphere. They have a very good seating capacity. The staff were courteous and they were very interactive. The service was fast.  Currently Six Course Meal offer is going on which is at just Rs 699/- only. Let's start with the review:  ‚óæBurnt Ginger Soup: They have both the options for vegetarian and non vegetarian. It had boiled Chicken pieces, lettuce, and other veggies and was served hot.  ‚óæSpicy Crab Roll: It was non veg sushi. It was perfectly presented. Crab and cucumber were stuffed inside the sushi. It had a sweet taste inside.  ‚óæChicken Sui Mai with Spring Onion and Garlic Ginger: These were non veg dumplings. Minced Chicken along with spring onion, ginger, garlic were stuffed inside it. I liked the stuffing a lot. It came with 4 pieces. It was hot and soft. The essence of ginger and garlic complemented its taste really well.  ‚óæDiced Chicken with Spicy Pepper and Chilli: Diced Chicken pieces were tossed in red chilli sauce. The Chicken was tender and juicy. Crushed black peppers were sprinkled over the dish to enhance its flavor.  Main Course comprised Steamed Rice, Stir Fried Noodle with Beans Sprout, Vegetable Thai Yellow Curry, Chicken with Roasted Chilli Sauce.  I liked the Chicken with Roasted Chilli Sauce a lot. Chicken pieces were tossed in chilli sauce and it was perfectly cooked. It went well with the steamed rice.  At last winded up the meal with some desserts. ‚óæOrange Zest Darshan with Vanilla Ice Cream: It was honey noodles with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I really enjoyed this.  Overall, It was a pleasant visit. I would like to recommend others to try their six course meal at such an amazing price.  Follow @hunger_above_mind on Instagram and do follow my Zomato Account üòç
Food - 5.0 Service - 5.0 Ambiance - 5.0 Value For Money - 4.5  Pros: - First and foremost, Zomato Gold. - It's value for money even without Gold though. But Gold makes it a place worth visiting very frequently. - The sushi was absolutely delicious! - Nasi Goreng was tasty too. Although I wish more chicken satay came with it. - Need I say anything about the ambiance? Out of this world, literally.  Cons: - Nothing major, I just wish they had a wash basin outside. You need to wait for the washroom to be vacant if you want to wash your hands.
Authentic Asian food is something I can have it anytime of the day. Gong is one of those places which you can drop by to have authentic Sushi or Asian or Thai food.  The calm ambience can just set your mood . Had been there for dinner. The dim lighting and the soothing music is what I liked the most. There was a serene aura which created a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy the food. Any meal of the day can be sorted by their ambiance.  I tried their 6 course meal which was for Rs. 699/-. Let's review the food I had in that meal:  ‚û° Hot Burnt Ginger Soup - It was the best dish to start with. Soothing consistent soup which had delicious flavours and a lot of veggies including boiled chicken piecesüëç  ‚û° Chiang Mi Uramaki Roll: It was the Veg Sushi in the 6 course meal. Every component in the sushi added its individual flavour to the dish which made it more lip smacking. It had a nice crunchy taste in its inner part when you have a bite.  ‚û° Chicken Siu Mai with Spring Onion and Garlic Ginger - These were the non-veg dumplings and the dips given with them were damn good. The dumpling layer was also thin and also the inner filling was good. Minced chicken with a nice garlic flavour is itself a nice combination.  ‚û° Diced Chicken sauced with Spicy Pepper and Chilli - This had chicken pieces tossed with chilli , tomato and other sauces and served with black pepper pieces with it. It was so damn good that the dish was finished within a few mins. The taste was great.  The main course spread included Steamed Rice , Stir Fried Noodles with Beans Sproutand and Vegetable Thai Yellow curry .  Everything was perfect and the Thai curry was scrumptious. It was an authentic Thai curry with ample veggies and consistency in the gravy with the authentic flavours blended to perfection.  ‚û° Chocolate Swiss Roll and Orange Zest Darshan with Vanilla ice cream - These were the desserts to wind up the meal. The Swiss roll was soft and tasted nice.  The honey noodles with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream has always been my favorite.  This place is perfect for Asian and Thai cuisine. And this 6 course dinner is the best one to try their menu at a cheap price‚úå
Been there a few months back for a party with my friends. The ambience is pretty cool and the staff are very courteous especially. Tried some of their items along with drinks. We ordered peri peri fries, tandoori mushrooms, pizzas and white sauce pastas. Each and every items aced in sense of taste however, the tandoori mushrooms were the star.

The soup was good. The bar didnt have moscow mule. But had usual cocktails. The chicken starter suggested by waiter was average in taste.  The service was prompt and good. Cutlery is unique, it looks like stone vessels

Very nice sarvice
We started to eat and the place was infested with cockroaches.... they were there under the table and on the table... there were flying around ...!!    Please DO NOT GO HERE! DISGUSTING!
"Food was average and I'd rate this place higher in ambience than food and the menu. Tirmisu and another soup requested was unavailable. What is worth mentioning is the episode when called for the check. Please note the bill image. I was told ""compute isn't working"" and given this handwritten bill. Firstly, instead of lasagna, the bill mentioned Musakka which was priced Rs. 10 higher than Lasagna. I was charged ""VAT & GST"" both being at 5% of the bill amount. As far as my knowledge goes, the total tax (GST for restaurants) is 5%. Here, there was VAT (in spite of no liquor) that too at 5%. Also Note that No GSTIN on bill copy. After reporting this, the restaurant staff seemed confused and hesitant. Finally after showing them that GST should be 5%, I was asked to pay the reduced amount. I demanded a corrected copy of the bill to which I was told that they 'will whatsapp me' and noted my contact. It's been a week and I'm yet to get a copy of the same. My request to all you guys: Please check your bill. I am not sure if this was a 'honest' mistake or some way to scam me.¬† #AlwaysCheckYourBill #Don'tGetScammed"

One more addition to the rooftop resto in baner/balewadi. Amazing ambiance and view from the rooftop. It has live bar counter too. It has big dance floor, 1 floor below the roof top with good dj. Food is amazing. Service is great
Beautiful ambience We went in afternoon for some coffee and snacks They do have DJ and dance floor at night The food is good and service also very good But the ambience is just awsome
"Awsome food and ambience, special thanks to ""Ms. Vaishnavi"" for her hospitality, really loved it.....extra star for her hospitality..... Crowd was super amazing in Christmas Eve, if dance floor would be there it could have been super amazing, otherwise great experience so far in pune"

Overall 3.5  Phenomenal Rooftop Ambiance, loved the foot tapping music vibes in the air. Lively youth around. Excellent place to hangout with bunch of buddies. Weekends are jam-packed, so prior table reservation recommended.  We ordered, kiwi daiquiri, kafir lemon chicken and chilly chicken pizza. Food tasted great and served aesthetically. But a bit overpriced.The quantity is not at par with the prices.  Service is slow.(SC in overall bill, is not justified,seemed forced). At least the drinks should be served, together with starters. We waited at least 15-20 min for starters to served.  Overall, a great place to hangout. Definitely worth a try.

Worst Food and service I have ever experienced in Pune
Dinner place for dhaba food lovers.. best served is chicken kolhapuri & chicken lajawaab.. not too spicy but the taste of their food can definitely make u happy .. recommend to visit with family / group of friends..
Tasteless food and poor service
The food quality has deteriorated. Punjabi food didnt taste punjabi.
We had been to this restaurant on New Year's day. The ambience is pretty good. The service was slow which might have been due to new year's crowd. The starters were okayish. The main course was good. But I feel the place is way over priced. The masala cold drink was terrible. It had too much jaljeera and lemon in it. Special mention to the piping hot jalebis. These were really fresh.
Really had a hard time there.. There is not a single thing which can make your mood to enjoy.. Service was superb slow, food was very sober in taste. When it comes to staff, waiters are polite but bouncers are so rude.. They don‚Äôt have manner how to talk to ladies.. I would have rate it 0* if I could. I would only suggest not to ruin your evening. Instead go out to other available places in Baner rather going to this cheap bottle rock cafe.. There are plenty of wonderful places
The great night for me and my girlfriend we just love the music DJ's playlist is to good we enjoyed...... food is ok service is ok ok but the music great
It was an amazing night . The live music and the band was awesome...had great time .we really enjoyed the music and the salubrious ambiance ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
We went here to celebrate birthday. But the pictures and ambience in real is not matching at all. In reality the place looks bit shady and there was no ventilation. We all were sweating like anything.  The staff is friendly but food quality is average. We ordered murg Mussalam but the chicken was half cooked. The prices and the food quality is inverse.
Didn't find it a good place to hangout. Drinks were not properly prepared and served.though service was good but food quality is not good. DJ and band is also not very good to attract someone to the dance floor. My rating would be 1. Don't go after watching flashy pics on google . You will find it totally opposite. If you are going don't expect much.
Really good foood! Literally everything is well made!

Restaurant close time is 11 pm but they turned me out at 10:45 pm. They should change their close time on Zomato. Really disappointed with this service, Where is a hungry person supposed to go in the middle of the night.

I had a long walk on the path of tatse in buffet and was very excited to have it in Barbeque village rather had negative reviews. later on it was true. That was my worst experience in terms of Ambience, Service, Taste, delays in food processing. It deserves to be worst in this category. Tatse is the priority for making customers satisfied and happy but they didn't know how to serve them. Starts from starter which included pani puri which was too salty then paneer tikka, corn was over fried, pineapple was citrus and cooked well. Gajar halwa was not good, mouse was so so, limited type of breads, No biryani. Lots of things through which I can't recommend anyone to go there.  Message If you can't dishes to put down then Shut down.
Sorry - Not upto the mark. Very limited options. The delivery is damn slow. The buffet was not ready and had very limited options. Example - They mention 10 deserts in their buffet but the reality is they count fruits ( Water melon, musk melon, one more). They mention 3 live counter but reality was Pani Puri, Masala puri, Dahi puri. Entire experience was pathetic. To add to this food made me sick after eating here.
Went for dinner buffet with family. The starters were sad- chicken was too spicy and extra burnt, fish was stale and prawns were tasteless. Crispy corn was too salty, paneer tikka was too bland ( like eating raw cottage cheese) and after and hour they came up with pineapple grilled. Chicken wings were okay on the spicier side. The main course was looking even more sad. The arrangement was not at all lively. The dessert had mainly cut fruits, mini gulab jamuns, custard, pineapple cake and ice cream. Service was slow. The only savior was their mocktails, those were okay. Would not recommend anyway.
Worst noodles i ever had. Too mch dry, nd taste is not good

Great Place!
This is a cozy little place on baner pashan link road... Pretty pocket friendly with good quality of thai - Asian food... Must visit
Great place! Good quantity! Great service and ambience. Recommended!
"The managers were adamant on making me pay again even after having received my payment!! I had paid using my debit card and the amount had been deducted the machine showed ""approved"" and yet they asked me to PAY AGAIN as they were unable to print a copy of the same. The problem was in their machine but they kept arguing instead of checking the machine. Lastly the copy got printed, but even then they did not apologize!! Avoid paying by card here."

Good and consistant food and service. Also quantity is huge. Location is also convenient and has been ordering from them for a long time nice. If you want to have good chinese, this can be a good option.
A small Chinese eatery situated in Baner, we first ordered for chicken wonton soup, it was delicious perfectly made , then we asked them to suggest us a good dish , on which the waiter suggested sizzler which was quite disappointing in taste , we also ordered for Chicken American Choupsey which was good. Overall I would say Chinese lovers should try this place.. The place is beautifully decorated.....
The quantity that they serve is huge. Have ordered food many times from online. Every time it is good food and value for your money. It is in baner pashan link road and easy to spot. Keep up the good work.
need better packaging. there was oil leak
A small joint on the fast-developing baner pashan link road, seating area is small and preferable for groups of 4-5 people. The food was average at best, we ordered Singapore Noodles after discussing with the waiter and yet he missed out on an important detail, they were thin noodles, and we were disappointed. Pan fried noodles had a good taste and was also huge in quantity. Also dragons of heaven was something I could eat again. Overall, nothing special or noteworthy about the place.

I have ordered full mutton curry.The food is smelly and testless.In full mutton curry there is only 3-4 pieces of meat.Very unsatisfactory service by Nandeds main non beg restaurant.only name is famous unless useless restaurant.

Worst quality satle chicken used for tandoori chicken
Worst food quality and taste issues.Dont order never from here
Don't order biryani here or eat in the hotel..... Don't have a sense to a waiter & captain in the hotel,how to talk to customer..... Quality of food is also not up to the mark.....

They have tastiest food in Nanded.And they give more than enough quantity also.Best hotel for food lovers.
The way I was provided Soda..in a bottle probably used by some customer in restaurant.. Must be remains of that customer..was served to me like that..and biryani was also of poor quality..pathetic restaurant..never ever order or visit !!
satisfactory quality
I do the first on zomato from This restaurant & i got very bad experience.... In a order i was added paratha but I got chapati also the paneer was so Piquant

I was there in the city on the occasion of Guru Parv , so while roaming around the city found this outlet. Not very jazzy kind of restaurant but one can sit and eat peacefully here. I ordered fried rice n Manchurian. Taste was not very good, but overall worth the money spend on it. The person I guess he was the owner itself was serving with a smile on his face. So overall worth it.

It is a nice place situated on the banks of the lake of Khadakvasla. The view is great and this restaurant serves delicious food. Service is quick but is slightly overpriced. Expect them to charge a premium for this place. They serve drinks.¬† The place also has a lounge and a hotel. However, it is recommended to sit in the outdoor seating for a better experience.
Good Nd fast service ü•∞ Taste is very nice !ü§™ Dam side view is very beautiful üòõ Staff is also nice üòçüòçüòçüòç
The ambience is good but to get there is tough due to heavy traffic and terrible roads. Okay, even if you reach this place after so many obstacles, please do not expect great food and on top of it, it's extremely costly despite of being in outskirts. A roti costs you 45 rupees, a small fish starter is for minimum 600 plus taxes so imagine how much you will have to pay for other stuff. Food is okay, very very ordinary which you will find in tons of restaurants in town. I think visit once and then say Tata bye bye forever.
I visited this place with my friends. Our main reason to visit this place, was for the view. The food here is average and the service is good. I would rate this place a 3 on 5
The manager was rude and unwelcoming. The ambience is great and food is up to mark. However, the manager is unpleasant and the staff is untrained.

Food was good but swimming pool was not good,water quality was not good everyone is facing issue liking itching and patchy spots.They should have taken care of quality checks.
I am still regretting why I went there :) . We went for a team party with a group of 25 People. The overall resort is pretty good in ambience and pool and Mountain View. We had a great breakfast as well. We played lot of games. But still why m saying worst . Here it is . When we went into the pool, the caretaker or servant whatever u can call was always giving us insta ruction on what not to do which we alreAdy know.:) coz we are not illiterates. The music what we expect when we do rain dance or whatever was not at all good. When asked to change the songs they said it‚Äôs not a DJ , u go and change. This is how they talk to customers. When we actually went and changed the song and increased the volume , that servant came and scolded one of team mate in a very rudely matter and almost fought with him. Ok that was not end of story . The water in swimming pool has some chemicals in it. Almost everyone got affected and today which is like after 3-4 days our skin is still burning and itchy and got white spots all over the face. I am really not sure who checks on the quality of the water when u have such a big resort and u don‚Äôt keep any quality checks ?? Seriously ?? Pathetic management. Food was good but if we go here and take a dip in their dirty pool you will definitely regret . I urge everyone don‚Äôt even mistakenly plan any party here .Also please train your staff on how to behave.
Quite a day outing place! We were offered a buffet for lunch as well as breakfast. The lunch was amazing. They buffet offered 2 different salads,coleslaw,soup,raita,papad,2 veg. Gravy ,1 non.veg. Gravy(which tasted completely like gaavran chicken as we say it).Dal and rice. Dessert had options . Staff was helpful. Service was quick. You get a view of Sinhagad fort. They had indoor as well as outdoor seating.
Wildernest at khadakwasla is one good place for a small family outing of one day. The place is about 10 kms from the dam. Personal transport if preferable It's a resort with swimming pool, playing area & badminton court. They too offer a Vila or Rooms for stay As situated on a hilltop the place has beautiful scenic view Breakfast , Lunch & Dinner are served well and are good Food is nice and the evening tea with onion bhajjis made our day. Place is silent and so can also be used for team conference and all. Although they can add-on more activity areas at the resort.
Went to this restaurant while coming back from sinhagad. Awesome ambience , Good parking. Ordered Special Chicken Thali. The thali was delicious and had Maharastrian touch to it. The chicken rassa was very good. Will visit again.
This was the first place where I had the authentic Maharashtrian food. OMG it was yummy. Special Chicken is what I had ordered. It was awesome and they serve it ASAP. The taste of chicken curry was amazing. The ambience was full Desi and I loved it.
Been here a couple days before... I ordered was 2 veg thalis and to my surprise i found out a dead cockroach inside the paneer sabji... This at all ruined my day.. And yet they made us pay half of the bill.. Being a foody and visiting a lot of places this place had the Worst service and worst staff i ever experienced..bad bad bad experience..wanna rate a minus star but can't üôÅ
Been here for more than 5 times...Awesome ambience (especially at nighttime) ... Genuine Maharashtrian taste.. Quick & Prompt service... Keep up the great work guys üòäüëç
Stopped by this place on the way back from Panshet dam visit. Good but not great. Interior is good, nothing lavish but comfortable compared to the other options nearby. Food is also ok, bit spicy and too much masala for our liking.
Next to Khadakwasla dam shores,this is garden restraunt, nice for family not individuals They have their big screen on in garden to watch cricket match...... Chicken is good all kind P. S. - Sunday most people go for drinking
We stopped by at this place for lunch last weekend, while driving back to Pune after visiting Sinhgad Fort. The restaurant is part of ‚ÄòSavali Resort‚Äô on the Sinhgad road near Khadkwasla. The place has basic seating and seemed to be clean and hygienic.  The food menu is quite exhaustive with options of Indian, chinese, finger food etc, but¬†¬†we stuck to Maharashtrian cuisine and ordered the Mutton Thali, Veg Maratha, Khichdi and Pitla Bhakri.  Mutton Thali was good and comes with both the rassas- Pandhra and Tambda , plate of Kharda mutton, 2 big jowar bhakris and a plate of Indrayani rice. Rassas were flavourful, Tambda was spicy but not overpowering. Mutton was tender and juicy, very well spiced but not too hot.¬†¬†Highly recommended  Veg Maratha was amazing, veg koftas in thick spicy, red gravy.¬†¬†Again highly recommended. Pitla was mild and went well with freshly made Jowar bhakris and Thecha. Khichdi was average as it seemed like rice and dal had been mixed after being cooked separately.  Good place to have a meal in case you are visiting Singhad, Khadakwasla or Panshet.¬†There is a small play area as well to keep little ones busy and ample parking facilities.  A big shout out for Mr Buddhadev who took our order and ensured that service was first class. Dishes are decently priced and overall good value for money.
Pathetic ambience and garden huts. Service is more pathetic. Waiters forget your orders. Kitchen is super pathetic. Cheap on wallet, cheaper in returns.
Good place to visit..Outside the city rush and traffic jams..Fresh and chilled atmosphere as near d dam..Carry jerkins and sweater if I want to sit in lawn area..They put a bonfire..Ample parking space.. Talking about food..Quality is good, we always have chikan handi which is very tasty and pieces are tender. Starters are also gr8. Service is good, quite fast..Except the rush days.  Nice place to visit with family n friends.
One of the places on Khadakwasla - Sinhagad Road. Service here is laid back (considering the rush its very obvious) But if you have enough time and want to just relax from the hustle bustle of the city this is the place you should be. Been here twice, food is average... Nothing that leaves a mark. Tikkas are good. sometimes they put on Cricket matches (which can be a problem if you are looking for peaceful dinner).
We had ordered dal khichdi schezwan fried rice and veg kadhai... Starting with dal khichdi.. it was very good.. schezwan fried rice was not good.. veg kadhai was good though
An ok place to dine out on the way to khadakwasla or sinhagad. Food taste is average and at pocket friendly prices. They should pay more attention on cleanliness.
Rustic pit stop for decent breakfast serves nice maharashtrian misal, wada sample ‡§≠‡§ú‡•Ä. The misal doesn't look ‡§ù‡§£‡§ù‡§£‡•Ä‡§§ but it is.  Hygienic clean place. Parking is avalible
This is very good and wonderful place. I will recommend to anyone. They offers specially veg and non veg rolls but also the other food like home made dishes. The ambience is very nice and taste is very best.
In a remote area such as khadakwasla, Just Franky is a saviour. Do not expect extraordinary food. They serve home style fare in main course which is quite decent. I would rather recommend their rolls and sandwiches though. They have a good variety and are tasty and very filling. Do ask for a less oily version. I personally prefer it that way. On Sundays they have tandoori items. These are outstanding! Absolutely succulent and delicious kebabs and soft melt in the mouth naans. To summarise - If in khadakwasla, it is a humble little place where you can grab a quick and tasty snack. It is clean and hygienic. Prices are reasonable. Do try.
If no choice then u may try it for snacks n cold drinks ...big no no for meals .....avoid Indian food for sure .....frankies are still ok ......small canteen next to khadakwasla lake still no crowd ....so you know d reason...... Need to get better cooks for sure
Been here for many times.... Not at all a great ambience but trust me the food here is great.... Do not miss this place if travelling towards Sinhagad.... Masala papad and chicken handi must try...

I visited this place on valentines day .... The music and dance were too energitic ....i juat loved the mood swings Just in others section improve the flavours ....its gives a hard sensation at throat ....üòÖ Btw hakka noodles were quality üòã
Fairly new place in town and that too near Khadakvasla, Sporty, Lively, and we'll thought of decor n sports theme.. First to mention amazing n courteous staff members right from the captain, manager, waiter to the cleaning staff..  5 mins after Khadakvasla Dam, Tables are nicely spaced n spread so that u don't feel Ur sitting right next to the other table, clean n tidy place, Wow prices on alcohol and many offers too, the place is open until late and they will serve u with a smile till the last minute.  Food we didn't order much as we happened to zero onto this place at the last minute however whatever we had was good. Dugout, Opp Essar Fuel station, Khadakvasla
Very good food with amazing music ....... The staff were very kind.. good place to hangout with bunch of friends and couples .. I would give a 5 star rating ...
Awesome seafood restaurant. Highly recommended to every seafood lover. Newly introduced Fish Thali is very attractive.
Good ambience, tasty food
Loved the ambience and the food..the staff was courteous and the live music was nice too..wud be coming again..

very mediocre food quality and unprofessional home service delivery . Also,quantity is also not much. The delivery guy doesn't care or didn't know about the packaging item.

Ordered chicken tikka starter - less quantity, taste ok Then ordered Hong Kong noodles - good quantity, best taste..  I will say he you haven't eaten noodles for while and happen to be near sinhagad road, visit here and taste this awesome noodles. Could have rated 2 stars but noodles owned the third one.  Ambience is not so good, the space is less inside and you have to sit outside with people walking besides you everytime.
Today I have called to order on their home delivery no. and before completing ...the lady asked me I have customers in front and will call you after some time....then who I am ..not a customer..and no one called back...worste experience ever ..sure they will shut down soon if the approach is like this to customers.
I ordered Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani, it was my worst experience. I regretted and i shouldn't have ordered..quality n taste was very poor. Not worth for money
Incorrect order# Along with pav bhaji i had Order extra pav, Paid 25/- extra, but did not receive the extra pav.

Bedi's naan house good for casual approach. If you want family dinner then it not that good Here chole bhature is only average dish and most importantly they even not give the feel of Punjabi restaurant feel but here gulabjamun is really so juicy and tasty üòã
Not at all edible.....suffered food poisoning after eating veg kolhapuri and naan....please improve hygeine and quality of the food....not satisfied
""
The food is pretty good, I love the tastes of all the chicken gravy it's really one should try. The owner is also very soft spoken its a pleasure eating there
I ordered chicken rice and the rice was undercooked amd smelling awful. The taste was disgusting. The quality of the food is an eyeopener to the fact that the food is shit.
not good quality
Its an old hotel in its vicinity, u get here food till 2am easily, chicken do pyaza is awsome , its a must try dish , rates are reasonalble ,cheese paratha is not at all good .
Not bad when you are hungry and there is nothing else to eat around. I dropped by with couple of friends to have lunch, even they felt the same. Taste : 2.5/5
I ordered chicken Biryaani from here. It's perfect. All the spices n all. You should really have it once then you will understand what I am talking about üëå
Poor taste, high price, will definitely not recommend anyone to go this place. ambience 2 out of 5 Food 0 out of 5 Staff 4 out of 5 Value for money 1 out of 5

While traveling from Pune to Lonavala we saw a good restaurants in vadgaon on old Mumbai Pune highway, it a lovely place but not much crowded. Ambience is good. Food and service it just ok.. The also have room to stay.
Had been to this place few month back. The food quality and taste was just ok ok. Could have been better.
Overall it was a decent experience @ Cafe Koyla Below is my view point: Ambience:8/10 Food taste :7/10 Staff: 5/10  As mentioned it was a decent experience, however there is a scope of improvement when it comes to staff. They were quite slow and sluggish. But, it is a good place to give a try.
While travelling from Wakad to Lonavala we stop at a restaurant it was cafe Koyla near makai chowk ambience was just ok. Food taste & portion sizes is on average side. Their was only one captain to take order, so for order you have to wait for him to come. Need to work out on staffing. But Staff was very friendly.
Yaaay! Finally found another place for sheesha in town... Cafe Koyla is amazing place with good vibes for sheesha lovers...As always I‚Äôm good to people so people are also good for me.. So good and friendly staff.
Worst patiala lassi.... not worthy ...

Portion sizes are really too small ,taste is good but compare to price ..portions are too small.

I got the pizza delivered so fast...like in 20 mins...it makes me wonder if the pizza was already made for someone and given to me or things are really speedy here...anyway I'm impressed....10/10
I had place an order at 9:46 for Rs 430 prepaid they called me and told me all the route is been blocked so we cannot deliver there so i can cancle the order here it's showing that your order is delivered. They are doing cheating i want my refund.
For vegetarians this place is very good.. It serves tasty food .. Spicy and delicious just like home. When a person in need he will go there to eat tasty food nearby... Loved it... Rate is also low..
When in need for a simple vegetarian food this place is recommended. Food quality is very good. Service is prompt. It is simple traditional sitting veg restaurant.  Rating  Food-4/5 Service- 4/5 Ambience-3/5 Value for money - 3/5
Timely delivered. We ordered veg biryani...taste was really awesome. Felt quantity was little less as compared to other outlets of same area.
Visited this place after around 6 months yesterday. The management has changed. The service wait time has increased like anything and food taste also is not good. After ordering the main course, had to wait around 45 mins for the food. Also, the new staff is not courteous like the previous old staff. Overall, may be due to management change, the outlet which used to be good in service and food quality, has lost its charm.
They take too much time to deliver the food. Best is to order online from this restaurant. Parking is a big problem as restaurant is located on busy street.
Good place ........to hangout ..............good food..........nice stafff.......... everyone was so friendly here......... excellent service provided by the staff
Great little place for a quiet dinner. Offers a variety of Continental and Indian dishes. I have been here several times and it has slowly become one of my favorite restaurants in the locality. Highly recommend the Lasagna and Sizzlers. Basically, you cant go wrong with the Italian dishes here.
Staff was polite & food was ok- tasty. The fries in my sizzler had too much flour & still half of them were soggy & bitter. Rice & Veggies with Bbq sauce in sizzler were good. Quantity seems ok-good for 2. Soup was served very late, it was tasty though. The service was slow despite the staff was polite & attentive. Paneer tikka was very spicy for our pallets but we enjoyed it. üåüüåüüåü3.5 for Food üåüüåüüåü3.5 for service üåüüåüüåü 3 for price & VFM Main problem was the ambience as it was constantly smelling like how house smells like after pest control or mosquito coils. There was no natural ventilation nor the A.C. was on so it was suffocating. I had to step out of restaurant by requesting my food to parcel it cz of the discomfort. üåüüåü for ambience
Food was awful. Ordered Tom Kha supposed to be Thai soup but tasted like Chinese soup. Asked them to change but another one was also no where close to Tom Kha. Ordered Keema Pav spicy. To my surprised it was sweet with overpowering tomato taste. Asked them to change but still the tomato taste so strong that even after adding spices it still had that tomato tangy taste to it. I was also surprised to small bite size slices of loaf given instead of pav which was not even enough. Ordered garlic naan. It came overloaded and soaked in butter. So much so that i did not even feel like having it. Some how had half a naan left the remaining naan and keema. We just wanted to get out the place. We lost the appetite completely. Ohh I forgot to mention, looking at some food my wife even canceled her phad Thai noodles. Thank god they allowed us to cancel other wise I am sure it would have been another disaster I am sure. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone unless they change their chefs. Also want to mention that wash room was filthy and my lil daughter (4 years) wanted to use it but looking at a condition even my daughters reaction was yucky n said don‚Äôt want to use it. Will never visit again. Only positive thing was our order taker was very polite and helpful. Unfortunately don‚Äôt know his name.
Utterly disappointed. This had been one of our favorite places and recent experience just ruined it all. the place has turned very shabby. The staff is clueless. It has lost its shine and would avoid this place until it revamps thoroughly!!
""
One of our all-time favorites one. They actually had the best survice if you compare to the other restaurant in our area. But as it got a little older the survice became more slow, and they take way too much time to prepare your order. But!!! But! The food is still delicious üòãüòãüòã I love their range of menu, my personal favorite would be chicken crispy from their place. I also love the mocktail and cocktails they have in the menu. The bar at kaveri is also really good, they have quite a good range to choose from üòçüòç
The ambience of this place is quite good.  The food quality and quantity is amazing. The dynamic of the price of food & quantity is  good. There chicken fried rice, chicken crispy and murg mussalam is to die for!!! Its super delicious! There food fills your heart‚ù§Ô∏è
Worst behavior of waiters with customers, did not allowed to sit in family areas even other guys were sitting and made us wait for 15 min in front of dirty table where the area was totally smokey also the waiters were ignoring to clean the table after calling multiple times.
Worst place to be. If u go in group and only guys then they will treat you like anything. I will not recommend this place to anyone and also there are people smoking and not a place for family too. So avoid it

Ek number misal....!! Perfect taste...I have been here twice now but both times it tasted great...worth visiting this place..they also serve dadpe pohe ..which tastes very good..coffee is also good :-)
First things first, this is home cooked food just outside your home with perfect taste. I have been to this place 4-5 times till now, and plan to keep on visiting for great maharashtrian food with typical traditional taste. Following are must try items: Dadape pohe, dahi wada, zannat misal, kanda pohe and most of all, sabudana khichadi and dahi. Din ban jata hai!!üòçüòã The owner is very decent and courteous. This is a small venture but would not let your one sunday go without having this dilemma what to eat yaar... Misal? Dahi wada? Ya phir se sabudana khichadi?? Cheers C.C.A team... Keep making me come back.
A great place for all misal lovers.The misal is enough spicy and can be customized accordingly.The quantity they provide is more than enough for one person. They always serve the misal hot and the pav soft. This place maybe small and not too fancy but it does serve great food and provide great service.

This is awesome place for the food especially the chicken is the best dish here... Chicken is the speciality for this place. As compare to another branches Gavakari, Warje is the best.
Had heard about their food and hence tried Chicken. But we could see Food quality is not good. Had tried 3 times before writing the review. Quality of chicken was questionable. Hope they live upto peoples expectation.
#verypositivereview  One of the best restaurant for Non-veg.   Chicken Thali includes, Chicken Masala/Sukkha Egg Curry  Tambda Rassa Pandhara Rassa Chicken Kheema(comes with Spl. Thali) Chapati/Bhakari Veg. Pulav  Dine-in or Take away but must try.
If you are visiting this outlet with expectation of getting same food quality as that of Kothrud outlet, then you will be totally disappointed.  Bhakari was like papad and white rassa was tasteless white water. Chicken was good but rice was just average.
The place is strictly okay.. the quality of food can be better
Visited this place when it was on zomato gold. Frankly speaking we were looking for a good restaurant on cold winter nights which will be accessible within 2 3 kms from our home. We were literally pleasantly shocked by looking at there menu. It was exceptionally well designed, covering all aspects from salads, soups to deserts yet the dishes are combined with the ingredients which makes you feel that you are eating at premium restaurant. The custom your dish part of the menu was most exciting which was on on zomato gold offer for your information. We had chicken chettinad wings and flamed griiled paneer served with spaghetti. Both the dishes were quite amazing, skillfully made and extreme good in taste. 5/5 for the chefs art. Simple dish like chicken momos was also delightful. At last there homemade brownie with vanilla ice cream made our finner date complete. Addition of pudina leave along with brownie and ice cream was master stroke. We'll definitely visit again. Keep up the good quality guyz.

One of my favourite place for a tasty meal.All the salads are tasty and comes in good portion.Ordered fish and chips and the fish (Basa) was cooked to perfection.For dessert I tried Tiramisu and it was one of the best dessert I ever had in pune.  Overall an excellent place to have salads,pastas,desserts  Would love to visit again!!üòá

Visited Trikaya a week back with 2 of my girl friends.  Currently the outer seating is under renovation but the indoor seating is available. It was a nice, quite dinner nite as the restaurant was not much crowded.   No complain about service and ambience.  We had the following things :  1) Lemon and Peach Ice Tea, Virgin Pinacolada- All the drinks were good in taste and big in size. Enjoyed them throughout the meal.  2) Thai Spring Rolls with Glass Noodles - Loved the spring rolls and the honey chilli sauce that came with it. There were 10 pieces but they were disappeared pretty quicklyüòú  3) Crunchy Veggies Pan Grilled with Teriyaki Sauce - As the name suggests, It was assorted grilled vegetables tossed in Teriyaki Sauce. It was decent, maybe teriyaki sauce doesn‚Äôt suit my palate.  4) Paneer Tawa Masala -  It was our normal paneer cubes in red gravy with onion and capsicum. The taste was nice and the paneer cubes were extremely soft.   5) Butter Roti, Jeera Rice - Both well prepared and nice in taste.   The choice of desserts was very limited and very common like gulab jamun, jalebi, kulfi.  We decided to skip desserts.

Went to Trikaya on pre-diwali nite. Ordered a mix of asian and Indian food - and liked the taste alongwith it has ample quantity for 2.  Resto has parking space in the building it is situated, on that day it was half full so didn't took time for getting a seat, nice ambience and fast service with courteous waiters.  We ordered cottage cheese chilli pepper in starter and it was wonderful, soft paneer with different taste, and ample pieces for 2. Ordered Manchow soup it was good too alongwith it. In mains we ordered mili juli tawa sabzi which is basically mix veg and dal makhni with 4 butter rotis. Both the items were good and rotis were soft too. Liked the food. Above order comes around Rs.1500. Will definitely try it again. Recommended.  Ruchir.
Having heard a lot about Cafe Peter, finally visited their Bavdhan outlet today with my friend. Ordered Gochujang steak for both of us. Chicken breast with gochujang sauce on bed of rice with hash brown & veggies.. well I loved it. So will be definitely exploring more of their menu. Excellent service too!  The manager is really helpful and staff was really nice. Must visit 2020!
Great ambience
Recently visited Bavdhan outlet I had HOT Coffee it was amazing i had Masala Omelette as well really like the desert. Also I had cheese chilly toast which is my favorite and was very much impressed by the taste because it was exactly taste the way I like.  Ambiance was really good and there manager is really good in Hospitality services. (management).

I have been a fan of this place since a very long time. However lately things have been terrible with this place. This is my 2nd and I am sure the last experience. Ordered Mutton Wade & Prawns Pulao. Mutton was absolutely uncooked... one can say RAW. Wade were like a papad. Gravy tasted the same. This is a classic example of an excellent place getting ruined.
Bit expensive but taste was good. I went there for lunch. I ordered majorly fishes as a starter. Chicken & Mutton dishes as a dish & their special dessert mud pie. Fishes were well fried & delicious. Curry dishes weren't something specifically special.
It's cosy place. If you are looking for fine dine then try somewhere else. But if you are non-veg specially sea food lover then this is the place. Great taste. No show off. We ordered Surmai rawa fry & kokani chicken curry. Fish Pieces were big. It wasn't very oily. Fish was fresh. Chicken curry was awesome. It had that homely feel to it. Balanced taste. Loved it. Highly recommended!! P.s. Food was so delicious forgot to click photos..
üòÄ Taste was just Awesome üòÄ Polite staff ‚òπÔ∏è Slow Service ‚òπÔ∏è Restricted Non-Veg Menu  Lion eats any meat but you guys focus on only üêü.Please add chicken thali in your menu and more options of chicken.

We ordered Paneer Tikka Masala and Veg hundi. Paneer was not at all good. It was hard. And taste was not good of both the dishes. Nan and roti both were difficult to chew. I had it‚Äôs food before but it‚Äôs deteriorated.

D Palace! Restaurant which is famous for Seafood and Murgh item situated near Chandni chowk! Restaurant contains a proper sitting arrangements which can manage big group of people too! To enjoy more restro also has dancefloor, live streaming & sexy bar too! As our meeting got over me and my colleague headed towards this restro! We ordered! Chicken Crispy Chicken hot pan Chicken Angara Kebab Murgh handi Overall food review was awesome ! Service was excellent and friendly! Love to visit again!

A good joint with a family crowd serving delicious North Indian food....pastas were tasty tooüòãüòã. But hold on don‚Äôt go for  Pizzaüçï, you have much better places to eat that..crowd puller because of their tasty punjabi dishes. Good place for quite family meals.
Awesome food and very good service .Loved the garlic bread ..Will definitely visiting this place again..Very much recommended for pasta lover
""
Good choice for Veg food. Bit overpriced as compared to others. Parking has lots of issue. Also, try to reach early else WAITING FOREVER
The food quality has been maintained for quite a long time now. Very good. The biggest drawback of this place is the ambience. Too dark and dull.
I ordered home delivery of bhel puri. It was highly disappointing; it wasn‚Äôt even bhel. It was Diwali chiwda with some water in it and barely any tomatoes or onions. ‚Çπ80 for this? Please improve.
A very good place with excellent food, especially for chat lovers:  Must try: Veg Thali, Jalebi (must must try) with rabdi, all chat options, Pani puri(They serve free Pani puri to Pregnant ladies), Paratha Ambiance: Average  Staff: very nice and friendly.  Service: Fast  Will visit again: yes
Food was good.But we spotted a mice in the restaurant.
Ambience: 3/5 It doesn't have any great interiors or decor. But the place is comfortable with enough seating. It's good for lunch/dinner or evening snacks. Best location as many commercial buildings and offices are located in this region.  Food: 5/5 They have a variety of menu. Snacks- chat items samosa chat, SPDP, kachori, pani puri etc. All are delicious.  Must try Sweets: Jalebi is the best jalebi in town. Gulab jaam is also huge n very soft n tasty. Rabadi is awesome. Pure milk and very creamy. Rabadi Jalebi is very famous.  Main course: Thali- lunch thali which has different menu everyday. Vegetable, rice, chapati, dal, salad, raita. Perfect meal for reasonable price. Parathas- tasty n filling parathas pocket friendly prices.  Service: 5/5 Quick and efficient. Serve hot fresh jalebis made specially for you..  Value for money: 5/5 Quality and quantity is perfect. Worth every penny spent.  You can parcel Hot Jalebis to treat your loved ones.
Very great taste, good seating area, good service, variety of cuisine, good option for a good lunch or dinner.

Pocket friendly hotel. Good food option. Especially the pasta was üíì.. good quality and quantity.

Quality & Quantity of the food is good but service is very slow. Staff is inattentive.

Delivery service is too much pathetic. We can‚Äôt relay on domino‚Äôs for late night delivery. I order food at 12mid night after 2 hours I got notification that food is delivered. Dominos senior level manager should look into this issue. When I tried to contact they answered irresponsibly. Very bad experience.
The worst pizza i ever had...... i asked for assistance and still have the pictures captured for proof ....  they can‚Äôt even deliver pizza mania properly
""
Instead of delivering fries for my first order, dominos delivered potato cheese bombs. #Very bad first experience. Never gonna order from Domino's again. Refund has to be processed for this wrong order
Food is good
Nice service by Nirmal and Captain Khem
Best service taken by hotal
Best service given by nirmal order taken by mr khem

Very lazy service there is no crowd for hotel but still they take 2 hours to complete our dinner
I went to this place on January 1-2020 for dinner, this was not the first time I came to global Punjab but to my surprise the service now is really pathetic.  Even though the food is good in taste but when you order main course along with starters knowing that already there is a delay Yet for main course one vegetable is served on time while other was served when we finished our chapattis. When I asked about how much time will it take for sizzling brownie ( p. S I didn't wanted to wait for dessert hence I asked while we were eating main course, ) during this time my friend said bluntly to staff that service is not good Yaar. He said not to order brownie then in that case.  Really dissapointed with service because it was really topnotch at one point and being Magarpatta Resident have visited here on multiple occasions.  But yes taste was as expected I. E Good Only thing they need to improve is service.
The service is really really slow. The staff is not cooperative.

I ordered gajar ka halwa. It was stale and stinking. Waste of money and time.
Order tandoori paneer wrap.. excellent taste.. however I had received an SMS to receive a free cookie cake that I did not receive unfortunately..
One of the place from where you can order food at good price. I think they just provide delivery. They have various options to choose from. Food is good, quick delivery.
I had ordered Tandoori Chicken Steak Meal, Chicken Mughlai Meal & Teekha-Meetha Chicken Wings.  Tandoori Chicken Steak Meal -: Nice tasty food and sauce was great. Quantity of rice can be little more  Chicken Mughlai Meal -: Dish was great. Can improve quality of paratha.  Teekha-Meetha Chicken Wings -: Starters was awesome.
Taste and quality was good but chole curry was very less compared to rice....also packing previously was better but this time all the things were mixed in one box & not separate packed....
The best place for chicken lovers üòçü§©
I think this place is a bit overrated. The Shawarma I ordered did not live upto my expectations. I have tasted far better road side Shawarmas. The size is too small. All items on menu very overpriced.
Ordered both chicken and paneer shawarma. Chicken shawarma was definitely up to the standards but paneer shawarma was definitely bad in taste. Paneer was burnt and tested like burnt milk.
INTRODUCTION¬† ¬†Marrakesh has been the key name when it comes to Lebanese Food in Pune. I have been Visiting this place for a long time now and still there is no change in the taste what so ever. Marrakesh has more than 10 outlets spread across Pune. Its famous place for its non veg and Lebanese food. ¬† ¬†¬† ¬† FOOD ¬† ¬† Makrana Kebab ¬†¬† This is their signature kebab this is a must try if you are going to visit it. These are nice Chucky leg pieces of the chicken marinated for a long time with the tandoori spices like the tandoor masala, red chilli powder, ginger garlic paste. This is then barbequed/Charred in the tandoor. The marination is spot on just perfect with the spice and the leg piece are so succulent and tender that you can‚Äôt get hands of the kebab. ¬†¬† ¬† Paneer Makhani ¬†¬† Being a famous non veg place this place shocked me with the veg offering they gave. This was chucky pieces of paneer which were cooked in a thick gravy made of tomatoes. The gravy had an amazing saut√©ed flavour to it. To this gravy added some butter to give it a nice buttery taste and hint of garam masala to finish things off. ¬†¬† ¬† Butter Chicken ¬†¬† This butter chicken is really a bench mark for me. I really love the butter chicken they serve here. The gravy is tomato based into it they add hint of garam masala and lots of cream and butter. This gives it nice creamy texture to it. to finish off the gravy they add hint of fenugreek powder. The chicken is cooked in tandoor and that‚Äôs added to the gravy. The chicken will blast flavours and then you get a creamy after taste of the gravy. ¬†¬† ¬† VERDICT ¬† I have been to NIBM and Magarpatta outlets most of the time and the taste at both the outlets is exactly same. I have heard complains for other outlets but never for these outlets. the food is amazing and you never get disappointed with it.
Looking for awesome food? Marrakesh is the go to place for all punekars. With it's branches spanning across the city, I ordered some food for me and my colleagues from Marrakesh during my office lunch hours. I ordered following items : Garlic hummus with olives and pita bread, Kadhai paneer Zatar Naan Some Tandoori Naans & Malai phirni in Kulhad  The quantity and quality are the most important aspects of any food outlet and Marrakesh truly stands by it. We were full by the end of our meal. Kadhai Paneer was deliciously tasty.üòã I have tried hummus at different places and hummus here could be improved but nonetheless it was good. The highlight of this meal was malai phirni , it was heavenly! It's a must try dish here.
No taste smell of gulabjam doubtful  My dad is disappointed with me for making him eat this food

Behrouz as a brand was much hyped since it's inception and being an ardent lover of Biryani, I was drawn towards it many a times. I clearly wanted to know whether it would meet my expectations! The only thing that always held me back was the exorbitant price and some of the feedback that raised concerns about the quantity. But having had their Lazeez Murgh Bhuna Biryani, I would say that it was just an average affair unfortunately. It's one of those instances wherein the quality gets masked by the clever marketing and the one of it's kind packaging(which now started getting replicated by other food chains). And as aforementioned, the unconscionable price doesn't help things either. The regular biryani is strictly for one and it comes along with a gulab jamun and salan or mint raitha as per choice. Talking of the latter, didn't get the raitha as per my selection and instead received salan. Minute human errors aside, for the price paid and the quality of food that's received, this is simply an average affair. Even though they've other varieties of biryanis, there's nothing that would entice me towards this outlet again.

Recently tried their butter chicken roll. It's damn good. I was very skeptical when I placed the order but it's all worth it. If you love butter chicken then don't miss out on this one. Infact they have more new additions in place. Also try their chilli chicken roll, that's also really good. I had ordered it online, they package it very nicely.
Usually always come here to have rolls when in DC. I totally love their cheesy jalepeno fries. The chicken nuggets are usually having 5 big pieces served and are crisp and delicious. Their rolls are a pretty good and very relishing. I totally love the barbecue cheesy chicken roll and mughlai rolls . The parantha of the roll had a really good flavour and the chicken filling was satisfactory and it didn't feel over cooked or oily. Overall a good place for quick bites
I am eating these rolls sinc so many years now. The taste never changed. It's always yumm. My favorite roll is chicken bhuna and aloo fry with cheese. Now they do have small bites to.. like fries, nachos and chicken popcorn and they are all good. They never compromised on their quality or quantity and that's what I love all them. Whenever they deliver home.. it's always packed rightly so that I enjoy my fresh hot roll at my home.
Rolls Mania This place serves some yummy quick bites, shakes, rolls and even ice teas. Their service is good. They also accept online orders. We ordered- 1. Chicken cheese nuggets- These nuggets were crisp from outside and juicy inside. Made out of finely minced chicken, it had cheese inside it but the quantity wasn't much. More cheese would have made it more enjoyable. 2. Chilly garlic jalapeno fries- Fries were heavily loaded with chilly jalapeno sauce. The one who loves spicy food, will like it. 3. Chicken mughlai roll with egg- Mughlai style chicken curry with chicken pieces cooked to perfection stuffed along with veggies. Stuffing was apt and also taste was too good. 4. Cheesy barbeque chicken roll- Barbeque chicken stuffed along with the curry and onions and few sauces. It really tasted amazing.

They really need to confirm order before confirm it. I changed their manu name as I mislead to just by sweets from combo and it just cost large. Thats very unexpected from tomato as well as from such resto.
Ordered a chicken Biryani online from here. All that was delivered was fridge cold rice & a smelly chicken piece. Eventually had to throw it away. Honest advice : save yourself from wasting away that hard earned money. Adios.
I got the food delivered at my place. So, I ordered Babycorn chilly. It was not much spicy. It was nice. The next dish that I ordered was Special Hyd. Veg. Biryani. As per the bandwagon, there's no such thing called Vegetable Biryani. But this place will certainly change your thought. They serve really good vegetable biryani. It was a perfect blend of spices. It wasn't too spicy but it was delectable. It was served with mughlai gravy, raita and onion salad. It tasted fresh and the quantity was good enough for two. Overall, it was a nice experience.
It's a definite try restaurant. I would highly recommend this everyone living Hadapsar in Pune city. The main items are curries and biryanies.
We had order paneer starter and found chicken bone in it. It's a very serious concern as my uncle is vegeterian. Also the staff was arrogant and the cook to. Very rude people. FDA please take action against kokkita hotel and staff. Mr. Vibhate owner was not ready to talk with us. I request FDA to take action against kokkita.

When complained about food to the Stewart no reaction from him on the same even the same thing from their manager

I want to give (-5) star to resturant, ordered 2 items, delivered only one, that too completely cold seems having aged Biryani. When asked to deliver left out order, they denied and asked me or order sweet (bacha huwa tukda) so that he can handover both the parcels to same zomato guy... complete order was delivered in 2 hours... pathetic word is better than their services
Ordered full chicken dum biryani but gifted with product of veg fried rice which has 3 pieces of chicken. no taste and no gravy provided by the restaurant. What we generally expect from Hyderabad biryani house is not what we get from here. Total disappointment.
uncooked biryaani, hard and chewy mutton pieces. didn't like.
Very bad quality dum biryani ... I am totally disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è Please maintain some basic quality to satisfy customer.  Biryani served without onion and raita.
Food quality was worst, rice was not cooked properly, veggies are not present only flower present. Was too spicy, not happy with biryani, never order from this restaurant again in future
"Yesterday I ordered food from BOX 8 as per their name the food is actually awesome. Very good quantity and packaging of food.  So I had ordered, ""Grilled murgh seekh kabab"" first time I tried this and really impressed with the taste.  ""Teekha meetha chicken wings"" in this they have their unique style of making it in desi way and taste wise it was totally awesome.  Then ""Butter chicken meal"" I would say everyone should try butter chicken meal of BOX 8 and you will fell in love with it. üíØ  Thank you BOX 8 for these awesome dishes. Definatetly going to order again."
The best brand i will recommend when the hunger is bigger than tummy...i just love their meals , so complete , so hygiene , so delicious and also so safely packed it is..i had ordered the chicken gravy meal box..it had came with chapatis and rice ..the quality of food is too good..it feels like home cooked ..must try
Butter chicken meal and chicken tikka Biryani these two are my favorite items and most of the times I have these both items from here only as they taste really very great and mind-blowing. Must try
Amazing place. My also To go place when it comes to ordering quick food lunch specially during my break hours. It has a wide range of options in the box which is self satisfying. Coming to what I ordered  Panner makhani gravy Paratha Moong dal halwa And Biryani The quantity it sufficient and the quality of food is great.
Fan of Desi meals? Try ordering from box8!Lipsmacking food served on your doorstep at affordable prices. Plus the delivery is lightning fast. Order through online sources to available great discounts. Food client is good and packing is very good to eat on the home or at work. They have extremely tasty moong dal halwa. Veg and non veg both are tasty and food is usually delivered before time each time I have tried from this branch. I have also seen the place and is maintained well. Box 8 has more than 30 outlets in Mumbai so your Desi meal craving can be easily fulfilled. They also serve great amount of salad with meals for you to have something healthy. Ordered the Kadhai paneer curry and paratha  and mung dal ka halwa.Overall a good place to order if you looking for an entire meal..

Mojo pizzaa is located in pune. The pizza's are well packed. It is best place for pizza lover. The delivery was on time. I ordered. üëâ Margarita üëâ Smokey Joe. If you're a pizza lover. I'll highly suggest you this...
The pizza delivery was lighting quick with Excellent packaging as always. The toppings were in great quantity and the price being reasonable is like a cherry on the top. Seekh kebab pizza and farm fresh pizza is something which you definitely don't want to miss.

My order was not complete. In my recent order, they did not deliver an Ice Cream at all. The customer support asked me to take a photo of the order? How am I supposed to take a photo of the item that was not delivered? They should check it with the restaurant and refund me asap. I haven't got my refund yet. Also the Daal Fry packging broke when I picked it from the delivery bag. Half of it fell on the ground and spoiled. Half was useful.

Ordered from this restaurant as it is near to my residence. Food ordered : Matak Biryani, Chicken Ra Ra and Roti's. The Biryani was great. Quantity was also ample for 2 persons. Slightly spicy but great taste. Chicken pieces were cooked and marinated well. Chicken RaRa was also good. Chicken gravy with kheema and small pieces. Quantity was good with 4 Roti's ordered. Overall the experience was good. Will recommend this place.
One of the best place to relax and enjoy food. We experienced best menu at pocket friendly price alongwith live orchestra... Highly Recommended

Visited this place for many times. A good place near katraj bypass highway at Vadgaon bridge. Offers good drinks and cocktails with variety of quick bytes and rice and noodles type dinner dishes also. We have tried most of their cocktails and chicken starters. Go for it. And it's pocket friendly as well.
This place is good and serves a great fun ful environment to the customer. The food taste good and the service is also quite good. The service provided by this restro is good and it serves the best it could. So must visit place.
"Pathetic food .Prawns biryani has 4 pieces of prawns . They forget to put cheese in ""cheese garlic naan"" Waiters don't care about anything .They didnt even serve water ,unless we requested"
Awesome food spicy chicken. test was fantastic.burger quality too Gud.5 star...... after eating. Really i like it..chicken is very crispy...it was yummy....and on time delivery....thanks kunal
I should have known better! I didn't see the ratings and the reviews before ordering. I blindly trusted this restaurant based on my experience with a similar restaurant in Katraj.  I don't even want to waste my time writing this review but I must express my anger. Because I wasted my hard earned money on this food.  The fried chicken was an abomination. And the quantity? Who are you kidding geniuses? Selling this excrement of a food at the rates of McDonald's and Burger Kings? Shame! Just for fun, try and check what your competitors are doing. I don't even understand how that business is still open.
The quality is very very bad.. I ordered thumbs up and the ordered me very cheap orange juice which tastes like syrup the chicken is not really a chicken its something else don't ever order from here
Bakwass quality food. Chicken is of worst quality.Fries are over fried.I doubt whether if it's real chicken or what.Burger fillings are also low quality. I honestly feel it's not chicken it's something else.
I t is the worst food I ever ate in my life. I ordered burger, french fries and thums up combo and the food given was really very bad. Firstly there was no thumps up it was oragnge color juice called as oro orange which was very bad. Secondly the fries were stinking very bad. And the Burger was worst, it was really worst. There was some unknown sauce in it which was very bad. Really worst restaurant. The Bread of Burger was not fresh. We are paying you so atleast we deserve a good quality food. It is a humble request to zomato please reomve this hotel Bakwass spicy chicken from zomato. Its really a humble request.
I'm happy they are back!  My most favorite dish of the place is Chicken Handi, this is best ever I've ever had till date. Curry is thick, even half portion is enough for 4 person. Quantity is huge with chicken served in masala in different plate and later can be mixed with curry. It's right spicy and delightful.
Purely overrated restaurants, and pretty expensive not worth it!! Its name now have been changed the new Management is even worse have murg musllomom that's the only dish I like there and even chicken maratha handi
Worst quality- ( Chinese cuisine) , staff don't know how chinese dish are . Very Oily , very spicy food. Even tables are not cleaned properly.
Staff is really Friendly, Calm and Disciplined. The Food Prices are really worth paying for the quality and quantity of the Food. Surrounding and ambience is also good.
Hi.. Order was different and delivered different... Ordered food was too salty as if they don't care of who's eating this.... I'm so glad.... Thanks .....

"I had ordered 2 veg thali, when we shift to new home so we can't cook on that day, received delivery 20 min. Late after Zomato expected time, and wholla! You know what I had received? Just 3 rotis 4 pieces of paneer, a bowl of rice and a dry subji along with sambar(Varan) for rice. So I suffering through extreme hunger decided to share 1 roti each family member of 3, after doing such heavy task during home shifting, and Restaurant owner is trying to offer me my refund for my incomplete order?(Unexpected) I felt very sad, disappointed, ""Did I call her to get my refund or to get my complete order so I can lunch properly?"" Why you guys feel like this that 'A refund to consumers is a remedial to your malevolence? If a costumer order a order it means yes indeed he/she has money to live life, he is not a Free food seeker to get refund after consuming incomplete delivered food? Do we? Totally unacceptable behavior my restaurant, If you are capable enough to bear such incidents only then order from here. And still I have not received my remaining order after paying for 2 rice plate through paytm."
Worst Food with very bad packaging üò°, and zomato support says it depends on restaurant service. Are you satisfied with the support !!! Very bad experience
Low quality food,waste of money,dont order any food in this hotel, I don't like this food , I drop this food in Dusbin, worst test of food,dont order
It was waste of money. Fully uncooked rice without any vegetable. Taste is pathetic. I will never suggest any one to visit this¬† restaurant.

Nice food. Lots of new and unique vegetarian dishes. Good food quality and hygiene. Polite staff. Space is a bit small or maybe because it's crowded it feels so.
""
I felt this place bit hyped. Everything felt very much average. Given the nice rating on most of the platforms, I expected it to be much better. Soup being the first impression of a restaurant, no special efforts was taken on it. Sizzler was average had better than this elsewhere. Pavbhaji fondue was good. Khaman Oxide was very good. Place was crowded. Service was bit slow. Sizzling brownie was not so good. Average food. Mocktails were looking good but we did not order any. So no comments. Ambience was really good. Rooftop and nicely decorated.

Relax is known to serve one of the best pav bhaji's in Pune. I tried Amul Pav Bhaji , it was good. Though the amount of butter could have bern more.  We also tried coffee and it was good too.  Ratings: Food : 4/5 Ambience: 3/5 Overall: 4/5
Relax,  This place is in sahakarnagar, Parvati . Its is a pure veg restaurant, they serve North Indian and Chinese food. We had paavbhaji , tava pulav, pineapple and sweet lime juice. Paavbhaji was ok and juice was good. Staff was polite but service was little bit slow.
""
Pav bhaji here is must try with hot coffee
My husband was very fond of this restaurant which reminded him of his childhood when he accompanied here with his family. Finally the day arrived when we decided to visit the place. We got the table pretty soon. We were sitting inside. The inside sitting was crowded with their staff and was making a lot of noise around. The person came to take order and introduced us to their mocktail n Cocktail range however we were not in mood for any. He tried forcing us for same. I clearly denied however he kept on insisting. We tried to order Some started like Chicken Spring roll and Chicken Junglee however he tired to convince us by saying Spring Roll will take 20 mins for this dish you should try our XYZ starter... I gave him a look and said i will still have Spring roll even if it took time. And guess what.. The spring roll was given within 10mins and Junglee was given after 20 mins. I don't have problem if the Dish comes late.. But the way that person was forcing us to try his suggested dishes (which was the highest priced in menu) got on our nerves. Means we go to a restaurant to have what we like to have and not what the waiter wants us to eat but this person was continuously hammering us with his dishes. Frustrated with the overall scenario we just ate starters and left. Was in no mood to continue rest of our dinner there.
When it comes to having good chicken dishes near my home, Nimantran is the first place that comes to mind. Perfect ambience for families to dine at with indoor, outdoor and rooftop seating which has this simplistic yet aesthetical interior that makes the gastronomical experience even better. We had chicken tandoori, pahadi chicken, garlic butter naan and chicken suka which was all with the common element - chicken but yet had a different unique flavour for each dish.
One of my favourite restaurant... they had set a bench mark when it comes to butter chicken... According to me they use to serve Pune's best butter chicken but recently when¬†i¬†visited again the taste was not at all like before... The quality has dropped tremendously...The butter chicken was ok .. there was a time when¬†i¬†used to recommend my friends to try¬†Nimantran's¬†butter chicken but today it was so disappointing.... It was soooooo sweet that now they can add this in to their dessert section as well :(
best place for Family dine out. good food, good taste, good location, nice ambience, good value for money. polite staff. and good quantity of food. parking place available.

Pune has started to feel like my 2nd home now given the amount of time I spend here these days. Visited basil deck with a friend yesterday. Indian lunch combo for 299 is a good option to go for. It's got a good spread.
The bruschetta here was the star, it has was not at all bland a perfect mix. The sizzler was soo good. The veggies were perfectly marinated in the sauce, very flavorful it was. I was a little disappointed by their indian dishes, it lacked the desi-ness.
One of the best place for food in this area  Lil costly but worth eating  Food is soo tasty  Loved pesto paneer and Paneer Chilli  Worth going if you look for taste
Nice little place in market yard. Loved the pastas

The food quality is extremely worst and it's too expensive. We had also ordered for a veg Briyani which was severed with burnt fried onions. Chicken dish was also not up-to the mark. Place is not recommended at all.
"We didn't get satisfied service i.e we had to wait for 30 mins for food, apart from that we got ""Cold mutton dish"" on the table. We had to wait for chapati, rice, rassa etc. A very frustrating experience in this hotel. There is no taste for ""white rassa"" ( one of the worst, disgusting taste ) in this hotel. If you want to enjoy the real ""mutton taste"", believe me please do not prefer & refer this hotel to anyone. #WorstTaste #WorstService #WorstManagement #WorstInHygiene #DontGo"
There was nothing to like. It was very frustrating experience. No taste to the food. Service is disaster. No one is there to attend you. Food is cold as it came from fridge. Don't ask about quality. I'm surprised how people are putting such a good review. Pandhara rassa is total waste. You charge service tax but where the hell is service!! I request you not to go at all. Please see the attached photo of rice.

Taste was very bad.. very very very bad.. I wish I could give half star.. Will not order again from here.
There was no rice in rice plate in parcel.roti and   Naan was half cooked.

Over hyped restaurants. Overpriced. Mutton fry was not that good. Also the tambada rassa was avarage. Only the good thing we felt was pandhara rassa. It was awesome. Otherwise there are many other restaurants who serve better authentic Kolhapuri cuisine. Solkadhi was so watery, no taste in it.

Everything is good overall about this place...anyone can try at least once...rice was tasty but quantity wise it is very less

The akkha Masoor here is one of the best you can ever have. I really like the food here. Especially the butter roti with Akkha Masoor. The quality and cleanliness is improved than the next time. It proved to be worthy for time. Also no tension and hassle of what to order.... So overall it's a very good place.
ATTENTION EVERYONE..!! I was a fan of this restaurant. They dont maintain hygiene much but i ignored it till now. But now i Regret it. Today i ordered Akkha Masoor from here and it had a DEAD COCKROACH in It.!!  Think 10 times before ordering from here. I am done with Jagat Bhari Kolhapuri.
11 east street cafe is one of the oldest cafes in Pune. It's got quiet some reputation to it.  FOOD  Machow soup. Soup is perfect to go in winters but if the soup is not upto mark it can ruin the whole meal. Order chicken machow soup it was okish not to good not too bad. It lack the taste of the broth. And I also felt the quality of the chicken was very less.  Bacardi Chicken Bacardi Chicken is their Signature dish. In this the chicken is marinated in bacardi rum. Then this chicken is cooked and topped with cheese and bacardi sauce. This is served along potato shaves and beetroot chips. I did got the potato shaves but no beetroot chips. The chicken was not at all fresh. I dont know how many days old the chicken was, it had a oily taste to it which is usually occured after keeping the cooked chicken for days. The sauce was Also microwaved.  Butter Chicken The same chicken story here to. The chicken in the gravy was not at all fresh. It had some oily taste to it. It ruined all the taste of the gravy. The gravy on other hand was good. Had a good tangy creamy taste to it.  VERDICT  Being such a renowned cafe there first PRIORITY should be serving atleast fresh food. The chicken was having serious issues into it. If your pricing so much it's mandatory to serve fresh food. Al thought the service was quick.
This place is full of surprises. Everytime I come they have something new to offer. I started with thukpa from the winter menu. Piping hot n spicy, this is what I needed for my blocked nose. Loved every drop of it. Next we tried the non spicy pan fried chicken schnitzel. Crunchy fried chicken topped with cheesilicious black pepper sauce was the perfect balance to the thukpa. The meat overload pizza was in reality an overload of meats on a crispy, crunchy base but I would have wanted it to be more cheesy. We ended with the Lindt hazelnut fudge topped with vanilla icecream. This one cannot be shared. We were literally fighting for each bite. Overall had a lovely time over some fabulous music n food..

What's better than kickstarting with place that takes you on wild trip. One of the best place to go for if theme is what you seek out for.

REVIEW:- Food Quality is best....it's a big deal to eat a Jumbo Chicken Burger.. Polite staff orders are serve neatly... Good Managment....Food quality is never been compromised at all....it's a treat for belly....that's all I could say....

Very rude staff.... last visit to this place and people should also realise that if they dont give a damn about their customers then there is no use of going there because oneday you will also experience what i experienced there. We just requested them to cut the burger in half which we ordered as my friend had a mouth operation but they didnt listen and instead they told us that we can throw that burger if we want. So very rude and mannerless staff.
""
Loved this place. Found it by accident on Google Maps while I was shopping and I'm glad I did. Good proportions for a reasonable price. Food tastes good, too. Only had issues with the hygiene and the lack of seating for those waiting for their parcels.

Maro-o-rin is mainly famous for their bakery products.. this was the first time I tried this pasta one of the best pasts ever Very creamy tasty perfectly cooked macaroni . compared to price quantity is really good neatly packed delivery was fast definitely recommend to try
My all time favourite place from my school time It has changed over the time but this place is amazing to be with friends. Coffee and tea is my all time favourite.
""
Heard a lot about this place as an old gem and thought of giving it a try.  To start with the place has a feel of old world charm to it. So makes it easy comfy.  Coming to the food, ordered:  Cheese spaghetti: 4/5 It had a nice cheesy and tangy flavour. One of the best things I found here.  Chicken mayo sandwich: 3/5 It was a very basic sandwich but tasted decent.  Chutney sandwich:2/5 This sadly was a disappointment. Based on the reviews I had read this is one their best sandwich but the sweetness in the sandwich didn't really go well.  Cold coffee: 5/5 A good cupa a cold coffe  Chocolate chip ice cream: 5/5 One of the best thing on the menu. The chips were so fine that they come in almost every bite and just make you fall in love with it.  Overall: Ambience: 4/5 Service:4/5 Food:4/5
""
It's been the best place to eat vada pav and masala taak
""
One of the best vadapav I ever had. This is the best place to get yummiest vadapav in Pune. Specially vada is so crispy n yeah it's crowded all the time. Masala tak is simply amazing. Must try place. Food - 5/5 Service - 4/5
The vada pav here is just awesome! They serve it with sweet+spicy green chutney which further enhances the taste !
Garden vada pav is always over crowded with peole waiting in a long line and surrounding the packing guys for their turn. Everything about this place is the best.
""
So, went to this restaurant with high hopes and an empty stomach in the afternoon. Firstly, had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table. We finally got one. Right next to the lavatory door. It was extremely disturbing as people kept going in and out, nudging my chair. We saw an empty table and asked the waiter if we could be shifted there. He just looked at me and walked away, then I saw why. They were dumping all the dirty dishes at that table. Ordered 2 dishes, biryani and a side dish. Both didn't live up to the hype. Also, the place is costly as ever..

This is very old restaurant in the town which service non veg food , good food , worth to try .crowd is not what you may be expecting at good place .
The baingan bartha which you supplied us today is not worth to feed animals . Will you please return our money. Horrible food.
We went to the place for breakfast early in the morning. Confused, we asked the staff for their recommendations and ordered Coorg Idli, Masala Dosa and Chili cheese garlic dosa. We absolutely loved the food except the chili cheese garlic dosa. It is one of their recommended dishes but it didn't suit our taste buds. There was generous amount of cheese on it and had a sharp taste of garlic. Other than that, everything else was perfect! Recommended!
Visited this place on a Sunday afternoon. Great ambiance, super cool service and decent food were the key highlights of the visit.  Ordered Cheese Potato Medu Vada, Thuppa Dosa (Ghee roasted), Malabar curry with Appam (combo). Medu Vada and Thuppa Dosa were amazing. The chutneys served were great and went well with both dishes. Appam was slightly crispy and somehow not satisfying and slightly burnt in the middle. I personally didn't like the Sambar, but that could be just my opinion. Was expecting a more tangy flavour considering this being an authentic South Indian restaurant. But again - in my personal opinion. Would be definitely visiting again soon.  Food - 3.5 / 5 Service - 4 / 5 Ambiance - 4 / 5  Overall - 4 / 5
Taste: 9/10 Ambience: 9/10 Service: 9/10  Taste: Ordered roasted onion garlic uttappa. It was perfectly cooked, onion and garlic was perfectly roasted and the batter was tasty as well. Sambar was delicious too. And the three chutneys were tasty. Special dakshin biryani was awsome. It had that impeccable authentic south indian taste.  Service: Personnel were very polite and they give you your space - they dont keep pestering you unnecessarily. Gave us time to choose our menu. Otherwise in some restaurants the captains are very nosy.  Ambience: brilliant. There was nice silence and the entire restaurant is AC.  They have many varieties of dishes. Will definitely visit again and try new dishes.
Always wondered about this place ! Today was the big day ! Went with my family for a dinner , the food was great the staff was friendly and guided to exactly what we would love eating ! Will definitely visit again to try many more dishes !

GREAT RESTAURANT!!! One should always try their food. The waiters and the people serving food are too amicable which all the more makes it an amazing dining place.
Best place for biryani lovers Starters Chicken tikka 5/5 Chicken tandoori 3/5 Chicken Resmhi kebab 4/5 Chicken biryani * Only Medium spicy* 3.5/5 Mutton biryani 4/5 Veg Pulav 3.5/5 Service was excellent 5*/5 The best thing you should have while visiting here is Chicken tikka and Mutton Biryani ! You will love the service and the speed ! Sure your hunger won't have to wait more! They even have parcel counter outside the resto
Blue Nile is best known for there good Nonveg food So after long back I've visited this restaurant located at camp.Best known for Dine place was crowded due to weekend both downstairs and upstairs were occupied and it was good family place.I ordered Tangdi kabab in starter which was served within 5min service was so quick Tangdi kebab was well cooked with spices and condiments it was tasty though and I had there speciality Blue nile chicken which was cooked with medium spices with thick gravy and egg gravy was perfectly balanced with spices and was light .I like the way they cook egg which was boiled without the outer shell of egg which is served on the top of the gravy I had this with Butter Nan which was perfect combo.Staff was polite everything was good but I found that the water glasses was very smelly that thing I didn't like about it.
Many times we visited this place. It is one of the oldest restaurant. Newly renovated with swanky interior, ample space.¬† We ordered Chicken Tangadi Kabab, Tandoori chicken and chicken biryani. Taste and service is good. Ample space for parking also wallet car parking is available. Good experience.
Love this place. Wish they had a branch in Mumbai!

I had heard a lot about this place and finally got a chance to visit.  N doubt people are crazy about this place. I happen to walkin in the middle of the day on a weekday and had to stay in line for around 20 minutes just to pick a packet of biscuit. But no doubt it is worth all the wait.  Loved their Shrewsbury biscuits. A must try for all
""
Very limited menu specially for vegetarians. One of the very few restaurants that does not serve any kind of dal. Portions are small although the food taste is decent. They do not give finger bowls and no mouth fresheners as well. Wash basin had run out of paper napkins. Overall, cooking is good but the administration of the place needs an overhaul.
""
Don't go with ratings always. We have planned team lunch at this place. It looks great from outside but opposite view from inside. No comfortable seats, no tasty food, ambiance is okay. Overall I won't recommend this restaurant at least for lunch.
The place is wonderful with a decent ambience and amazing food quality.....
First of all a big shout out to the ambience of this place. It's such a warm, cozy place with equally warm bunch of people. All the dishes that we ordered the best was the Apple Pie in desert and the fish fingers as starters. The other dishes that we ordered also tasted authentic except for the massive chocolate blackout which was the only disappointment in the whole experience, it looked very fancy but taste was not upto the mark, which is the only reason I have rated this place 4 . The place is so tastefully decorated, you will surely feel very fresh after a visit. Altogether, a great experience.
""
Best place for hangout with friends
Highly overpriced place.. prices not at all worth the with the quantity.. we ordered espresso and it was just one sip of coffee.. for 180 then we ordered a waffle and which almost costed inr 350 for half of the actual waffle.. the place is highly highly over priced in general. Please consider twice before visiting
""
Wanted to visit this place because it had best reviews,but I think we ended up going their on a wrong day,they were shutting down their cafe for renovation and 90% of the food on menu was unavailable,we just had to eat what our rude waiter got us,Beer battered fish chips and fries which tasted okish.May be I have to visit again to actually see why it has such rating.
Visiting Cafe 1730 is always a sheer delight! Although you are sure to have a great time no matter when you go but I would recommend you to certainly visit this place for the Sunday Brunch. They have a delightful array of treats and great offers on drinks too! Live events are mostly a part of this deal. However, they have interesting events scheduled round the week so it‚Äôs fun to visit it almost always!
Alfredo Pasta and Supreme Nachos were yummy. Ambience is classy and low lit. Live music was a treat. A perfect hangout with friends and romantic dates as well.
Nice place to hangout with your friends.. Serves tasty food and it was having live music when we had gone..! (I am not sure whether they have live music daily or only on specific days). Overall you have a very good experience. Would surely like to visit again. Must try for all..!!
This is my 4th visit here and have always recommended the place highly but I was very disappointed today. The quality has gone down in terms of food, the service is super slow, there is just one bar tender, two waiters struggling to take care of a 100% occupied restaurant! Prawns were not available, Bira isn't available, Sangria wasn't very well made-too sweet and ofcourse the taste has deteriorated a lot. Very disappointed. I have had amazing food experience here and fond memories but today I was very disappointed!
It was really nice experience. Ambience is awesome. Courteous staff. Food is spot on. Had the Creamy Chicken Nachos and Smokehouse Sausage Platter. In beer we had the Apple Cider and Hefeweizen. Loved it.

The Sassy Spoon is one of the few places in Pune that offers good food and a great ambience to its customers. I visited this place on a Sunday evening and there were a lot of people dining already. I'd suggest that you make a reservation if you're planning to come here during peak hours.¬†They offer a variety of craft beers along with your regular alcoholic drinks. The staff is very attentive and polite and they surely help you to choose the right dish for your palette. The food I had was really good and there wasn't anything that I did not like. This place is definitely upscale, so be ready to pay a good amount after you're done with your meal.
Ambience was great with pink car and high book shelf. Delicious food and desserts were an icing on the cake. A bit heavy on the pocket but a great overall experience. 10/10ü§©
One of my favourite go to places for Sangriaa n good food.... The new sassy squad menu is a total VFM.... Absolutely spoils u with choices n delectably tasty good food... Love the vibes of this place... My personal favourite is the Sri Lanka Poi and the crispy chicken over here... Try their hummus n couscous salad also.... N the wild mushroom chestnut soup.. Betcha u gonna come back for more

Ambience: 4.0/5 Food: 4.0/5 Service: 4.5/5  The Sassy Spoon!  So here I am sharing my review of Sassy Spoon of my recent visit. We tried pizza and thai curry. A must visit place.  Thank You!  Now you can purchase Zomato Gold using my referral code: KHUS91709

Ordered hot chocolate and they delivered hot milk ( which was cold till the time it was delivered to me)
The food is definitely very good, but the service and the staff working is immature, and seem clueless when put in with the a request. They don‚Äôt seem the professional types .  Even if you don‚Äôt understand a certain request which is quiet easy to understand, you need to communicate properly.   Was accompanied with an elderly person and the staff was not at all accommodating  Don‚Äôt recommend this for oldies, it‚Äôs more for the young crowd.
Staff need to be courteous. Also if upper sitting is closed then they should display a board. We went upstairs and had to come down again. Staff need to learn manners like if customer is sitting on table they should not disturb them.

The amazing ambience with cute little vietnamese lights and colorful stars was the usp of this place. The asian cuisine with just perfect taste buds was the need of the hour. We tried the filling Laksa- Ma thick soup topped with sprouts, noodles, parsley and some carrot soothing our hunger pangs. The next amazing thing is that the place offers starters in small portions feasible for tasting  any new delicacy so we ordered a vegetable tempura and fried tofu. The Pad Thai noodles was okayish and the service speed was mind blowing.
It was a pleasant surprise to find such a place, thanks to wifey. I am not usually a big fan of Pan Asian cuisine, but i guess this restaurant can make you fall in love with the food. We are vegetarians and if that was so good, I won't be surprised if their non-veg dishes are better. The soup, tempura, crispy tofu, pad thai, mocktails, everything was perfectly made for us and the condiments just added to the flavours. A must visit place it is.

This was my first leisure trip to Pune and When I asked for recommendations, every one said that I have to go here!  As soon as we reached, I was in awe of the ambience! It‚Äôs beautiful! This place is just perfect for a date night!  The staff was very courteous and hospitable. The one who was looking after our table Suggested us dishes as per our taste.   We tried-   Crispy Lotus Stem- can never go wrong with them! Crispy stems in sweet chilly sauce  Top Hats- It was like canap√©s only longer with veggies and sprouts. Did not enjoy it a lot as it was too green, healthy and insipid for my taste.   Pad Thai Noodles- They were packed with veggies, the peanuts added crunch to the dish. It was quite delicious.   Over all, had a great experience!  Must visit for fine dine and some wine!
Very poor service , no one understands English.
5stars for food and service food is outstanding panner quality is melted in my mouth and Tandoor item is fantastic. Special thanks to
I visited this place for a date and this place was quite adequate for that. The low lit atmosphere was complementing the occasion. The food was delicate and the service was quite courteous. We had a dance floor as well, where we grooved after having a drink. Must visit once for guys living in Kharadi and near by areas.
At least hire a professional DJ, Saturday day is not practice play
If you want quite you can sit outside and chill and there is an indoor seating as well with music and everything. Beautiful ambience. Good staff and service.
Awesome place to visit in Marol. You'll get live music with yummy foods. Must visit
Pathetic pizza and the base was very thick so it was extremely hard to swallow! Nachos were good but pizza not upto the mark
Rude Manager Mr. Robert! Doubt he has much training in handling customer qualms. Even with quite professional dinner visits like ours on 14th Jan 2020, and inspite of us having a corporate tie up with the hotel, this gentleman spoke very rudely - he didn't lend the slightest ear and was trying to brush away the conversation till the point we had to explicitly tell him that there could be consequences to our contract for the hotel by him behaving like this. This is not something anyone likes to say but we were forced to in order to make him even listen to our qualm. Luckily since we were corporate guests he settled the issue for us ultimately, but I can only imagine how he would behave with other guests without the privilege we had. Such behaviour ruins the experience of the place in spite of its ambience, decor, and food. This hotel Peninsula has also not treated our corporate guests well during their stay over the past 1 year. Seems like a n establishment with resources but inadequate HR training.
Place is good for group outing and the decor is also well suited to the name, but its bit cramped up. Live music performances are there which are great. Tried pizza ,which was not at all good. Overall good experience.

We tried their paneer starter and kapsa.Both were good.Food service was slow even though after telling them twice.
They are best in lip smacking food like mughlai,punjabi& chinesse. Its royal in everyway talking about its ambience or food presentation. It gives you a nawabi fell with the mesmerizing ambience. Staff is friendly and polite   Good experience

Persian Darbar is located in Kankia Zillion (Kurla). They have been pioneer in lip smacking food like Mughlai, Punjabi, Chinese and Raan.It is Royal in everyway. From the entrance to chandlier everything adds Nawabi touch to this place. Ambience is mesmerizing! It is brightly lit with beautiful crafted walls. You will surely feel like you are in a palace. Seating arrangement is comfortable and spacious. Ambience of this place is one of the reason to visit this place.Staff is well trained and friendly. I was impressed with their knowledge about food.The staff and service both are praisewothy. They believe in their brand and make sure they provide exceptional service.   What we had - Minty Mojito Apple Cinnamon  Harabhara Kebab Tawa masala  Laccha Paratha  Gulab Jamun  Overall a good place...üëçüèª
This Cafe is too good. The cafe is located in Marol. This Cafe serves authentic Italian food. They serve variety of Italian dishes. Quality food is served with nice quantity which is sufficient for 2 people.

I have been to ambrosia cafe at time square which was good. But this one was really pathetic Just ordered ambrosia fries and cheesy chicken popers. The fries were oil soaked couldn't eat, the chicken used in the popers was not fresh. They levy compulsory service tax for which we did not get the service even. Had to ask to get plates and glasses till then they were busy in their work. After i complained about the fries the waiter was ok that's it. Would not recommend.
Chicken satay - They were boneless chicken in sticks and had coriander garnishing. Butter garlic Prawns - These tasted heavenly, they were decently plated as well and the piece size was huge as well. Fusilli pink chicken - Fusilli is the shape of a pasta and it had shredded chicken, olives 2 pieces of garlic bread made in pink sauce. It was okayish in taste portion size is small. Stuffed Chicken - There were 6 huge chicken chunks with small portion of veggies in the plate and hash potato. This place is nestled in the corner of the famous times square building but in the D wing and they have a very cool vibe with live music on a sunday evening and open bar but the service is slow.

Had gone with family for buffet really reasonable for the spread they provided. Staff was very humble and hygiene at its best , I must confess we consider hygiene more important than food taste as we have fragile stomach.Great place.
Opera pastry is made with layers of almond sponge cake soaked in coffee syrup, layered with ganache and coffee French buttercream, and covered in a chocolate glaze. #marriott #coffeeshop #operapastry #opera #jwmarriottjuhu #jwmarriott #sweetdish #sweetooth #desserts #desserttable #mumbai #pastry #pastrylover #chocolate #almond #spongecake #frenchpastry #coffeesyrup #coffee #ganache #buttercream #glaze #jwcafe #marriott #sahar

It took 90 minutes to deliver very poor service and the delivery boy had no idea about the location also . The food served was cold and burgers had become soggy . Complete waste of time and money
This is located in Andheri Marol  One of the best place to go with family.  Best place to vist with family.  The best part was the ambience .  Famous for variety of burgers .  THE ORDERED FOOD WAS TASTY AND WITH GOOD QUANTITY.  HOPE TO VISIT AGAIN SOON.
While this place has okay food, they have a history of delayed delivery and acting totally casual about it. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend unless you are ordering at least something 1 hour in advance. At least.   Have often given them the benefit of the doubt. But definitely not ordering again.
Ordered noodls today it was too sweet n less quantity as compared to earlier order received...complained but not received any resolution

Visited this outlet with my friend and loved the services, food and ambiance.  Talking about the food we had Chicken Americano pizza which was quite good, it consisted of black olives, mushrooms, Chicken pepperoni and onions. The combination tasted good and would suggest you to give it a try.
Pizza hut It is located at chakala. One of the best option for pizza lovers. Service was awesome. Ambience was beautiful.

Pizza has always a been something that has been in my top favourite, and for someone who loves pizza, this place belongs to you witha variety of pizzas that'll make your mouth water, and a great offer of unlimited pizzas on every Friday for just ‚Çπ250, and its everyday value makes this place affordable and worth visiting
I found this place very attractive the atmosphere over here is one of the best the you will going to find anywhere else full of crowd staff was very good service was fast the management to look after the customer is good they able to handle the customer very well which I really found good really appreciate this i had fish tikka and other sea food  tasty was really good and food was great to have highly recommended ..
Something fishy.. what an appropriate name it isüòç i had a lot there.. i had masala koliwada as starters and then chicken dum biryani with kadai chicken.. the food was really delicious..they maintain high quality.. alao quantity served is really good.. Will surely recommend it
Tried their Chinese veg Platter. Amazing varieties available in it. Loved the quality and quantity of food. Also Dessert buffet was delicious as ever especially the gulab jamun and Rabdi, Really liked them. Do try it for sure.
It has great ambiance to offer. Great place to chill on. Ordered sea food and soup. The taste was awesome. Do visit here. Thankyyou!!!
So my friend suggested me this place he said I'll be in love in with this place and really it happened the ambiance is great and the food man it's the best non veg sea food I ever had , really give it a try here

Very nice place with great music and awesome crowd. Food and drinks were also good.  Little expensive drinks.
The place is quite spacious and the DJ is awesome. Food is okay can be improved. Only thing I didn't like about the place is the staff. Went there on Friday evening with group, the place was packed, staff is incapable of handling the big crowd and they are rude at times. 3 star is only for the attitude of the staff else the place is easily 4.5
The promoters don't know how to talk and are rude to the guests. The promoters show a general lack of professionalism and are not courteous at all This kind of behaviour is not at all expected from an establishment that claims to be this premium I would not recommend people to visit this place
The promoters are very unprofessional and their behavior is uncalled for. Unnecessarily harsh and ill-mannered, since the time the promoters have taken over events, the vibe of jlwa has gone down a few notches and I'd like to highlight this so that necessary action is taken for the place to light up once again.

The vibe of the place is too good and awesome service by Sooraj singh
This the best place to go to on a Friday night.It better make reservations beforehand. Ambience-4/5 Food-5/5 Drinks-5/5(they have 2+2 drinks if you use zomato gold) The staff is very efficient and friendly.

Ambiance 5/5  Service 5/5  Food 4/5  Dessert 5/5  COMING TO FOOD :-¬†  Starter - sesame chicken - very tender nice taste chicken.  lobster thermidor - if you love lobster offcourse you do..... must try them.  main course - slow cooked baby lamb masammne curry - lovely must try....  desert -¬† slice of turtle cheesecake - eat and keep eating its lovely in taste.
You name it and it is Bastian, one of the most hyped cafe in BOM. I was wondering as to what is with that place that it has so much of hype.  A small door at the ground level which takes you to the first and there you find the beauty with some amazing bottles of wine racked up and the most courteous staff which made me feel welcoming and the menu being the best of all.¬†  Now if you are a SEA FOOD lover then this is the best place you gotta go.¬†  I have tried Fish and Chips in a lot many places but here it was a CLASS APART.¬†  Tried for a chicken starter as well, the meat was so tender that it felt like it was melting.¬†  Would always recommend anyone who visits BOM to definitely go to this restaurant.¬†  YOU WOULD BE IN AWE OF THIS PLACE.¬†¬†  Thanks Bastian for such a lovely experience.

This restaurant has completely different menu of pizzas and side items which gives a new taste to mumbaikars!!must visit

Everything was really good a nice fancy place for a date night the ambience is pretty cool also the food was fresh and worth the price the sea food was fresh and clean. Loved the overall experience and would love to visit again. ‚ù§‚ù§üòç
Loved the ambience and the staff is so courteous. We loved the pork belly and the jasmine rice. The dumpling platter was to die for...
We have been wanting to visit Hakkasan for some time now and we finally did with parents...amazing service..amazing ambiance and excellent food...if I had to pick a best dish...I can't... everything was perfect...
I‚Äôve heard a lot about this place. So me and my friend visited here on a weekday in the afternoon. The ambiance and the decor were very fruitful also conveniently spaced out dining space, the eatery seems like it gives us a premium feel, the seating is insanely comfortable while the bar is one of the best I‚Äôve seen stacked with bottles neatly arranged. We visited on a weekday afternoon and we were welcomed in by the courteous staff and handed out the menus   Menu is not very huge but is curated carefully with a blend of Italian and tandoori dishes. We started off with some cocktails. The drink menu stocks some of the most premium bottles which also were serving mocktails   Tiki tika - this was blend of standard whiskey and some juices like pineapple, passion fruit syrup and blood orange   Rhode Island ice tea - this was a blend of vodka and cranberry juice. Gives a good nice sober kick   Last not but the least LIT with 5 spirits and cola   Starters :   Penne pinky pasta - this is one of the best pasta I‚Äôve ever had till date in my entire life. The pasta was so tasty that I can‚Äôt even express its taste in words. You should really try out this pasta ( highly recommended )   Carribaean chicken strips - I really loved the outter coating of the chicken it was crispy and the chicken was tender and perfectly fried. It was served with orange chutney which was spicy and gave chicken it‚Äôs best touch   Main course   Half and half pizza ( angry chicken and panner paprika ) - the pizza was basic it could have been better since the pasta was so amazing our expectations from the pizza were super high. Till the time pizza arrived on the table it was cold already. But it was eatable   Desert:   Raasta special : this desert was a chocolate pastry with three different layers with different Color same as their logo. The pastry was baked perfectly and was very soft to eat

Had an amazing weekend at raasta. This place has altogether different vibe, huge and cozy ambience, super tasty food and fantastic music.  Coming towards the food: 1. Angry bird pizza: Made of spicy chicken tikka, picked green chillies, and onions. Soft thin crust base topped with layer of cheese and toppings. Chicken was soft and tender. It was perfect in taste. 2. Garlic parmesan chicken: Grilled chicken fillet encasing garlic, spinach and corn mix on a bed of rositi. Chicken was soft and tender from inside and crispy from outside. Served with tossed veggies consisting of broccoli, bell peppers, zucchini, etc. It was too good in taste. 3. Jamaican chicken tandoori filet burger: Spicy boneless char grilled tandori filet burger. It was so huge that I was unable to eat. Okay in taste. Served with potato wedges. One of the best potato wedges I ever had. Full of spices.  After so much of eating time to drink something. They have variety of option to choose from. 1. Raasta special: As the name says it was special. You just can't miss out on this. It's a tricolour drink. Red at the topped followed by red and green. Perfect blend of sweet and sour taste. Highly Recommended.  Kuch meetha hojae. 1. The Raasta Special: This dessert has my heart. It's not just special it's highly special. It's basically their signature chocolate cake which looks too good and tastes simply awesome.  Altogether we had an amazing experience üòç  Hot eats, cool treats üòé Till then keep gawking at this üëÄ Follow @foodiechefs on instagram.

We had originally planned to try out the Sunday brunch but as the spread was not that good and the options were limited, we decided to go for a la carte. The staff behaviour was disappointing. He tried to persuade us to have the brunch and we really did not want to so he was being a bit cold. We ordered a half and half pizza and the Barbados platter. The pizza was good but the platter was terrible. The combination of flavours was bad on the platter. Paneer was doused in coconut gravy , mushroom in garlic butter and it was just not going well. When we said we have gold, we were tolf its not applicable but when we asked again and showed it by unlocking they said its there. There were no thank yous, or how was your meal or anything. The waiter you told us that the golf isn‚Äôt applicable then did not come to us and sent someone else. The staff was very cold and curt. I was hoping for a better experience. Food also being average.
""
Had heard many things about the hotel so thought of going.Prices are high compare to quantity of the food. Its a total waste of every thing.Taste was also not good.He gave the respective person feedback but he was not interested .Waiter was rude.Will not go to this place again.

The delivery person had no manners on how to talk to customers and should undergo training. This was a hell of an experience just to talk to him about where to deliver my order despite providing my address and location via Zomato.  Rest assure I will not be ordering from the place ever again even if the food gets here on time and tastes good
""
This is a place which make u feel royal and feel like your are out some where on tour as its ambience is awesome and the taste of food is mouth watering no words to describe this hotel just to say IF U VISIT ONCE U WILL WISH TO VISIT ALL THE TIME HERE ONLY. As it has a wide range of menu. Specially the kebabs and khebsa rice
The only reason I am giving 2 star is because they sent us the food at 2am. Had ordered Egg Biryani and what we got was White biryani rice over some gravy and two boiled eggs. It's not the first time me or my friends have eaten from Persia Darbar, nor was this the first time for that egg biryani; but this experience was a big let down. If the dish is not available rather refuse or not accept the order, than messing with the dish and upsetting a regular customer.
It the best place for Nonvegeterians. They have the best non-veg food and also their veg food is tasty. They are special in tandooris. We went there for friends outing and we enjoyed the food. If you are looking for top class ambience then this is not the place but if you want the best and authentic taste, then definitely this is the place. They have very courteous staff and the prices are worth the taste and quality of food.
people come seat for 15 mins and wait to order something but they don't give a damn.. you just need to watch the guys working their to place your order and if you ask them who will take the order then they will say yes the guy is coming . don't know the owner knows it or not.
""
It's a Dhabba. Food is awesome, chicken especially is delicious, they have kheema paratha, chicken tandoori, Chicken Poota, liver and many more. The place can easily be located it's is on LBS Marg so you don't have to go in any lane or so. The prices are also good and easy on the pocket as compared to other restaurants. They have a seating arrangement (table and chairs) have 2 sections, 1 for family and the other is general. I have seen women and family members coming there to have meal however I would suggest not to go here for a date. The place doesn't smell or anything and it's open air restaurant. So all is well. Chicken biryani is for 160, chicken Poota 250 GM's is for INR 100.
Nice quality food and budget friendly
They purposely don't accept sodexo card. Online it shows they accept sodexo. This happens twice they says there is no network for sodexo machine. And in same building McDonald accept sodexo 24x7. Never visit this hotel again..
There were some guests coming over for dinner on a short notice so we decided to order food from Hill green. We ordered: Achari aloo Paneer gulati Veg kolhapuri paneer makhanvala And veg pulao Everyone just loved the food. Everything tasted just perfect.
Headed to Hill green yesterday night for dinner with some friends. What we tried here: Paneer Hariyali tikka: fresh and soft paneer cubed infused with hariyali masala and grilled and served with mint chutney. Schezwan pizza: cottage cheese in schezwan sauce over thin crust pizza loaded with lot of mozzarella cheese. The food was delicious. The staff is very friendly their hospitality is top notch.
Pretty difficult to decide from where to begin. This place is by far one of the most fabulous places in the neighborhood, not only in terms of its food, but also the ambience, the decor and ofcourse the courtesy of the staff. I'll debrief y'all about the restaurant first.. It is a perfectly cozy, veg multi cuisine bar & restaurant, to hang out with your friends and family, and even occasionally in case you have a birthday to treat your friends for üòçüôà Without further ado, let us come straight away to the food. Absolutely delicious, is how I'd rate it. No numbers, no other wasteful play of words, directly cut to the chase. The variety of starters available will boggle your mind as to what to order. The Mocktails and Cocktails are wayy innovative. I personally didn't try the Cocktails, but from what my close friends have told me, they're no less than the perfect Mocktails that these guys serve. Of all, the Mirchi Mumtaz, really stole the show. It was the most innovative mocktail for me, amongst all that I've tasted.  Well, I'd like to tell you guys that The Hill Green, has come up with an amazing lunch buffet, (at just INR 299/- plus taxes, if I'm right) which is surely gonna make you and your soul, completely satisfied üôà. From starters, to desserts, everything is covered under the buffet. A complete package, unlike any other at such a comfortable price. I myself had recommended this place to my close friends and family, and the smiles on their faces when they came back to me with their feedbacks, said it all.  I really did not find a down side to this restaurant. It deserves all the appreciation and love, folks. A big thumbs up to the management.  Peace ‚úåÔ∏è
Hill green is a popular vegetarian restaurant. We were there for dinner last night. We had:  Paneer shikanji: Paneer made with hung curd and shikanji masala then grilled in tandoor.  Chinese sizzler: Delicious and spicy sizzler with French fries, paneer chilli with chinese rice.  Liked the food. The staff was courteous.
Hey guys PLEASEEEEEE better don‚Äôt order from here  I ordered and paid the money and still they‚Äôre like We haven‚Äôt got the order and then after sometime they are like yes this is your order but we can‚Äôt give you because you show Gmail the order summary and then they block me  I request zomata to remove them
I tried this for the first time, It was a amiable experience ‚ù§  I ordered üëáüèª ‚óºChicken tikka chur chur. ‚óºGrilled murgh seekh kebab. ‚óºTandoori chicken fiery wings. ‚óºTekkha -meetha chicken wings. ‚óºButterscotch bliss.  Their taste amazed me, each one is having a different delicious flavor which makes the dish unique.  Everything is excellent, chicken was properly baked, well in taste. I found the perfect taste here ‚ô•
Box 8 is acuisine delivery kitchen serving mainly north indian dishes.  We recently ordered from Box 8. The food was delivered within 30 minutes. Packaging was good to avoid leakage. Portions were really good enough for two and food was of good quality.  chicken tandoor wrap is my all time favorite  Loved their food.
The flavor is great, the accompaniments are spot on, and this is absolutely the best Biryani! The dishes are spicy and loaded with vegetables. The biryani is accompanied by raita and a hot spicy liquid condiment that goes on the biryani. You‚Äôve got to have a liking for rich spicy food, if you do.The price is economical for the quality.
Located in Bhandup it took 5 min walking from me. So I ordered some food from box8 which serves all Desi meals. What I ordered, 1) Shahi paneer biryani 2) Subz khajana biryani  Both are awesome in taste. The food which delivered by box8 was very fresh. Ingredients used in biryani was hygienic. Totally loved the food. nice experience.

Pav bhaji, cheese masala pav and dry fruit milkshake are always the best ones to try in Gopalas. I have tried all these a few times already but this time I didn't like their pav bhaji and masala pav much. They were oversalted but did have the same flavour in.
Pure veg restaurant so had to call for a Paneer dish. Ordered paneer tikka masala with butter roti. Marination was not that great but gravy was wonderful. Roti too was made really well. Overall it was a good deal.
The place is completely dedicate to Kanhaa.. you gonna listen hare krishana hare rama along with your dinner. Food is amazing .. especially their naan they are excellent.
I had tried their food with my family twice or thrice and its yumm if ur a vegetarian and looking for perfect dine out with family and a perfect food then must try this place.u will love it I loved their paneer tikka masala the most and that garlic naan and jeera rice with dal tadka was the best of allüòç‚ù§Ô∏èüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü

A refreshing place to go when you want to chill with your friends with good music and delicious food is whole package. We had hot n sour soup, Tandoori kebab sizzlers, hill green pizza. And in drinks we had, mojito and beers. Overall we had great time here.
Recently was in Bhandup and there was Indias cricket match, I found this place with screening so headed there. The ambience was good, simple yet classy interiors. Had NH7 cocktail which was combination of 3 spirits with grenadine and topped with lemon and orange juice. Along with this had pizza. Had such great time..
You can try Naram dil kebab with green chutney, it was presented nicely and the taste was also good. You can also try out Daal makhani, fried rice, pasta, all dishes were just outstanding! Gadbad ice-cream and Rabdi Falooda just made our day. Overall best experience with Bling The Hill Garden.
Basically it's a part of The Hill Garden restaurant. Drinks are also available here. Perfect place to chill out with friends. Attractive and colorful interiors with dance floor and the music which was amazing! You can try Mexican roll with sweet sauce - the combination was good.
Bling by The Hill Garden It's a casual fine dine place, lounge. When it comes to get-togethers, this is the most perfect place to visit. Located in Bhandup magnet mall. It's a pure veg restaurant.

Coffee by Di Bella has been my number one place to go for curing my waffle cravings. Infact, I had my first waffles of my life from this place (Versova outlet). Since then, Di bella have expanded all over the city and they also opened an outlet near my home. This particular outlet in Borivali is a decent sized which can accommodate about 20-25 people at any given moment (indoor and outdoor).  We had the following:  Ferrero Rocher Waffles - Fresh basked waffle topped with nutella and ferrero rocher served with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and a portion of whipped cream. The waffles felt to be a bit overcooked and were hard while the chocolate ice cream had a really funny pungent taste. I've had better ferrero rocher waffles in other outlets of Di bella. Totally disappointed with this one here.  Classic Wonderland - A treat to the eyes but not to the tastebuds. Fresh butter croissant cut from the middle and stuffed with 2 scoops of vanilla and a scoop of the same pungent chocolate ice cream topped with nutella sauce and rainbow pearls. The croissant was too hard to break on the sides as well.  Verdict - Di bella is really an amazing place to have waffles and coffee in this city but this particular experience did not live to the expectations. I hope they improvise next time and serve better to the customers.
""
ordered a chocolate explosion waffle - very nicely presented, crisp and chocolaty. tastes extremely delicious with the ice cream. they provided 2 flavours, both tasted great. loved the idea of them giving the ice cream separately so one can choose on how to eat. really tasty. a bit expensive.
Had to wait almost 1 and half hour to get our order!! Very slow service, at least five group went away out of the outlet as they didn't get their order after a long wait. Just one Steward (Ismail) was serving entire restaurant, he was trying his best but food was not coming from the kitchen on time. Senior person Mr. Aman was least bothered about the customers' inconvenience & was sitting in the kitchen. When I complain him about the scenario he replied very Unprofessional as if he is doing a favour on us serving. It was the worst and very awkward experience as I took my guests there for dinner. Not willing to visit again this place where guests are treated so badly..

The borivali branch of tea villa cafe is near from the borivali railway station serving great food as other tea villa cafes'. This is new branch of this cafe . Me and my friends had various types of French fries with mojito. The ambience is also pleasant. Loved being here..
It was closed on a Saturday night. Not sure temporarily or permanent. Request you to kindly update the information here, so that people don't land at a closed place
French fries pizza, this pizza had french fries on it and it was cheesy and I liked to have that. The pizza was baked nicely and also with that the pasta and the Sandwich from food Adda were great.

The Chocolate Heaven is definitely heaven for all the chocolate lovers.  So coming to the things I tried  The cheese fondue Fererro rocher shake must try Paneer Makhani pizza Baked hot chocolatemust try Irish coffee  I am surely visiting this place again to try their pancakes and waffles for sure A place is must visit for chocolate lovers.
We ordered food from this restaurant for my grandparents 60th wedding anniversary.  However all we could taste was spice and red chilli powder.  The paneer starter which was supposed to be cheesy and mild in taste was filled with green chilli chutney.  The gravy dishes ordered were stale and tasteless (only hit of red chilli).  Not happy with the price v/s portion ratio also. We spent a lot but in the end the guests were not satisfied.  Really disappointed.
Really pathetic

The First Thing When You enter the place and you will love is the Ambience and the amazing vibe this place has. Great Interior. Courteous staff and so well maintained hygiene.

Then Dragon Chilly Prawns, Tandoor Prawns then Prawns Rice and Curry in sezuan sauce. All in all, Worth it, worth the Bill & Quantity & Quality & Taste. Must Visit. Amazing Place!

Butter Naan - Bit crispy buttery tasted with less of butter A type roti to have with these yummy sabziii  Desert: Nutella Mini Pancake - Chocolaty super soft Pancakes served with Nutella and garnished really well.

Best experience at Persian Darbar . I loved Chicken bara kabab
Please make sure that the meat is well cooked and tender. The kebab I received were uncooked and pink from the inside and I wasn't able to eat them.
Worst butter chicken i have ever tasted... Some roadside shit they gave me... Tasteless. Wouldnt recommend it to anyone

This place is best for the kepsa chicken. This place it worth for the chicken. Their special dish is kepsa. This kepsa can be eaten by 4 to 5 people. This is pocket friendly for student. Lastly their custard has awesome taste. This place is different to experience the chicken dishes. Must try this kepsa disha
Afzal restaurant is popularly known for its variety of kepsas. It is also called as ‚Äú king of kepsa‚Äù . Afzal is a humble food joint where one can also find mughlai as well as Chinese foods. We ordered a schezwan Chicken kepsa and it was very delicious and was not that costly. One full kepsa will be enough for 3-4 people. Talking about the quality of service and food , it is worth coming again and again as quality of service and food was great.

Best place for kepsa. Taste and value for money go hand in hand. Really good. They should have their branches in suburbs too

Kepsa is my favourite dish as I‚Äôm rice & chicken lover i have tasted kepsa near by from all the restaurants of Mumbai but the quality as well as quantity served by Mumbai Darbar is satisfying the customer, they have A/c & Non-A/c dining area both with friendly staff.

They have some nice grilled and tandoor items in their menu.Good place for variety of non vegetarian foods.
"A good place for a quick lunch or dinner. Try their special ""chicken oyster"", it is sufficient for 2 people, tastes good with butter naan. Never try their biryani, it's just very simple and over priced to the quantity they serve. Don't miss their custard in the end"
its near byculla railway station. ambience is okay. quntity of food is wow enough for 2 people and pocket freindly too. i tried chicken platter,mutton gravy fry and butter roti.

Heard alott about this place and liked it too good music and good ambience but limited space thus crowd is more i would suggest if you want to chill with friends go a bit early so you'll get a place rather you have to wait nachos is pretty good trying out once is recommended
Nice crowded place. My suggestion would be if you want to hangout there reach little bit early, so will get a table or else you have to wait at bar counter. Food is good and the crowd is decent.
Riyaaz Amlani‚Äôs Social Offline concept acknowledges the increasing urban phenomenon of people working out of cafes as don‚Äôt have offices of their own. It offers a dedicated space, wi-fi, printers, and stationeries for a redeemable fee for those who want to work from here. The concept didn‚Äôt work well in the Colaba outlet which is rather small and always crowded with regular patrons. The outlet at Todi Mill takes care of this with a dedicated floor for those who want to work from here. Apart from providing a wonderful work place, social serves some of the most delectable foods and drinks in the town. My personal favourite and highly recommended ofcourse are choosa 69 and tenese chicken wings. It is by far my go through place of all times.

An absolute  luxury dining experience. From curtious staff to beautiful ambience. What an impeccable night with such delicious food and drinks.  Although the place is slightly priced on a higher end but worth it.   The food is exquisite and the chef left no room for for any complaint.   The Bayroute Hummus   Sebze Kehabi   Hibiscus cooler   Lemon mint   Cheese Zataar   Lotus Drama   An amazing experience, would definitely visit again and recommend others
My favourite place when it comes to indulging in Mediterranean cuisine  The place has super ambience and quality of service is top notch   Mr Bhairav made sure we were attended well.   Bayroute Hummus - 5/5 Best hummus in the city. A must order dish.   Sebze Kebabi - 5/5  A Tandoor of cottage cheese , Baby potato & Brocolli. Presentation was excellent and even the food.   Hibiscus Cooler - 5/5  An excellent cocktail. It is gin based with hibiscus scrub. Super amazing cocktail. The bartender prepared it very well   Lemon Mint - 4/5  A refreshing mint cooler. An ultimate thirst quencher   Cheese Zataar - 5/5 My personal favourite. It‚Äôs kind of a Mediterranean cheese pizza. It‚Äôs very delicious and it‚Äôs heavenly. Highly recommended.  Lotus Drama - 5/5  This was the highlight of our meal. Your Bayroute experience is incomplete without having this. Must have.   They gave us cream cheese chocolate date it was lovely  A fab experience. A little pricy but absolutely worth it.
Bayroute is pretty amazing and interesting place to visit. Lovely ambience. Hummes and pita bread was really amazing and wonderful quantity. This place is truly heaven for desserts.
Ambience: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Staff: 5/5  If you don't understand the menu do not hesitate ask the staff they'll give you good recommendation and ofcourse this is a different type of food not everybody likes it! But you should definitely give it a try and not to forget they provide #jain food too.. Probably not the entire menu but it's good enough for a dinner. Only bad thing about this restaurant is you have to pre-book and do the reservations, if it's not your day you might have to return from the gate!
Great place for Middle Eastern food. Most food items were amazing.
Garage inc has a great atmosphere which is complimented by the food and service. They've got a plethora of options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. I'd recommend the giant nyc burger, chicken tikka and you gotta end with the nutella cheesecake. Also, you have to experience the karaoke nights here.

Hey, So I was at Colaba and was looking for a place to sit and have some drinks and food with friends. So I will share my experience based on Food, Service, Ambiance and Ratings.  Food - We tried 1. Nachos with Beans 2. Jalapeno Sticks 3. Four Cheese Pizza 4. Fruit Punch Mocktail  Food was really great and was delivered really fast.  Ambiance & Service - Service was really fast and also staff was welcoming. Clean ambiance and various seatings available.  Overall it was a great experience. It was really experience.  Ratings - Food - 4.5/5 Ambiance - 5/5 Service - 4/5 Quality - 5/5 Quantity - 4.5/5 Presentation - 5/5 VFM - 5/5
about place: ambience is really dedicated to its name and theme is kinda desi and old school, some iconic photo frames and decoratives, pretty place to visit with loved ones, staff is kinda cooperative and friendly and yes they are attentive.  Food: they do have good range of cocktails and mocktails too, we had Virgin Mojito and Berry Blast (berry blast was basically frozen mocktail and it tasted really well and refreshing), the personally i‚Äôve loved the crispy chilly potatoes, pasta was really good and quality wise food was good enough, my colleague enjoyed his nonveg food too, all and all worth spending hereüòã  we had: Virgin Mojito  Berry Blast  Crispy Chilly Potatoes Chilli Fried Chicken American BBQ Pizza Pasta Napolitano (Spaghetti)  Cookie Dough
""
I went there on Sunday , when they had a Sassy FamJam - a fun and exciting Sunday Brunch with various activities for kids and parents and a delicious menu. There was a Special Kids Menu which featured a lavish spread of Nachos with Cheese Sauce, Garlic Bread with Cheese, Homemade Hummus with toasted Pita, American Corn & Olives Pizza, Cheesy Penne, Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwiches and more to fit the little-one‚Äôs cravings. All in all a must visit with family, especially on Sunday. Food - 5 * Ambience -5 * Staff - 5 *
Chocolate is nature's way of passing through the weekdays and Sassy Spoon does it right with the amazing bakery collection..!¬† ¬† One of the best Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse we have ever had.. light, fluffy chocolate mousse topped with bittersweet choco powder with chopped hazelnuts.¬† ¬†¬† Their ambiance is nicely litedup with outdoor seating to enjoy the fresh cool breeze specially during Mumbai winters.
Such a beautiful, warm n welcoming place, they made us feel at home right from the moment we walked in.  Highlight of our dinner that evening were desserts.  Basil ice cream with dark chocolate fondue with basil centre was outstanding.
Great food. Tasteful decor. Super courteous and helpful staff. Definitely coming for more.
Flavours in the food were not up to the mark. Price was also too high and you can get more tastier food than this one in any other restaurants as well. Apart from seekh kebab none of the dishes I tried was up to the mark.
""
Being one of the old places to eat in colaba, the quality and the serving quantity have actually deteriorated. The place earlier was one of the go-to places for majority of the people. But now, the people prefer something different. But, some of the dishes have been really the same as they were before -  ‚Ä¢Chicken malai tikka ‚Ä¢Chicken seekh kebab ‚Ä¢Chicken baida roti ‚Ä¢Chicken tikka masala  But, if you have never tried this place, you should visit it once atleast preferably late night, it'll give you a good experience.
Good mughal restaurant located at colaba. Tasty kebab n rolls. Good service. I had their mutton gravy with rumali roti. Good place 2 eat at with ur craving mughal food.

Great place, delicious food and absolutely amazing ambience. Cannot have enough of effingut. Definitely a must visit place. We were served by Neeraj, smiling and affable guy who made the experience even better :) Effingut + Neeraj = Terrific Experience

I had ginger pele ale. It was sweet and carbonated very different from the normal beers that we usually have.  For food we ordered  Paneer chilli Panner makhani pizza Americano pizza Veg biryani  The food was very delicious especially the Americano pizza. The Biryani was even better.  The service was a little slow but it was perhaps because it was a weekend.
Drinks and food, both were good. Especially loved the Mac and Cheese appetizer. Thanks for the great service, Yunus!
Havana is a pretty cool place to chill with your friends.. The staff was bit nasty and impatient may be because of friday night.. Overall the food was awesome It was not too pricey. The music was amazing, One cannot resist the dance floor
Place is good, specially the dj. Food was also up to the mark. Only thing was so disappointing is service. Really pathetic.
It was worth for money. Happy hours at this place is really more than worth. Well even with cheapest price taste were really good and staff were friendly. Service was good as well. I liked the this cafe very much and I'm definitely visiting this once in every month.
Everyone table was lightened with candle except mine. It was like i am paying less amountüòß
The place is really roomy to shake a leg. The menu is really limited not advised for people who wish to have dinners. Beer was awesome. Cordial staff.
Saw a baby cockroach near my plate
I was a regular to the Leopold until incident happened. Leopold needs to teach own staff how to behave with customer. Staffs are becoming very rude to customer especially the guards outside restaurant. He misbehaved with my family and not allowed to use washroom which against law. I think cafe Mondegar is way better in all terms
"Leopold has lowered its class by appointing waiters who dont even know basic customer service. The Card Machine was not working. The waiter's had an attitude of "" Get lost if you dont want to eat"" Plus they should be ashamed to add the service charge on the bill for such poor service"
So I guess Leopold cafe USED to be the iconic cafe of SOBO. But over a period of time commercialisation has ruined the very essence of Parsi restaurant. One item in the menu is AMRITSARI SANDHWICH (being from Amritsar, believe me there is no such sandwich). Prices are exorbitant viz a viz the ambience. So yes if u guys are looking for authentic Parsi food plus the culture, I would trust you guys to visit other Parsi cafes in and around Colaba but not this one.
For the first 10 minutes that I was there, I felt that the place was a total scam considering the lack of attention from the waiters and the pricey menu. But the food was heavenly and hence the four stars!! :)
Had heard a lot abt this place even if remember correctly, this was part of legendary restaurants ! Coming here .. ambience is okay and we realise that name is big. Food is really not delicious (as don't want to start 2020 hotel review with negative tone). Had order 2-3 items, quantity not enough, taste not enough. Place can be avoided? Read above
If you don‚Äôt make a reservation here they will ask you to wait for 1 hour 45 mins minimum. Wow that‚Äôs a serious waste of time!!!!! Also when we were there yesterday without a reservation there was no light. The manager there had a audacity to tell us since the light is not there there will be no service done hence till will take next extra 45mins even if we sit after the waiting time!!!  No courtesy, No politeness, nonprofessional. Rude staff.
Awesome place for a pleasant evening. Nice candel light arrangements and good food.

"Hi, Heard a lot about Koyla from my friends and read many reviews about this place hence I decided to visit this place on my anniversary. But to be very honest the place wasn't like we were expecting.  First thing, I booked table one week ago and asked the manager to allot us corner seat but he didn't do that and allotted center seat where we all were uncomfortable.  Second thing, while booking I asked manager if they can decorate the table with roses or something... He denied the request and said, ""We do not decorate the tables.""  I was shocked when I saw a decorated table just next to me... It was decorated for birthday party. I didn't understand the logic why he said No to me.üòî  Finally we ordered our food which were good in taste you cannot say yummy/tasty food but yes it wasn't bad.  And of course, Berry blast was mind blowing that was the only thing I loved there.  In dessert, I ordered Lucknow Ka Shahi Tukda... That was also delicious.  And finally, when it comes to price vs portion size I personally feel it's unfair. Koyla just have their rooftop terrace and Hotel Taj's view and nothing else.  Yes, of course! There are many better options in Mumbai to spend a romantic time and having dinner with your loved ones but if you want an experience you can go there.  Thank you for your time! Happy New year"
Food and ambiance was very good.. Nandu

Their tagline is appropriate _ They truly cook with love. Nothing beats Tiramisu from Dario's
Visited to try their vegan menu. Wanted to try zucchini soup was not available. Ordered broccoli balls, enchiladas, nachos, gannochi, and brownie..everything from the vegan menu. Loved enchiladas and nachos. Brownie was good as well..but gannochi was really disappointing. Service can be better.. Wanted to give 4 stars but noticed every table was served complimentary bread and butter before meals but notnus..Maybe they should veganize that as well. But overall nice experience.
I have heard a lot about Vohuman cafe and I got a chance to visit this place with my mom n we had our breakfast overhear. Here is what we had here :- Double egg Omelette:-4/5 Bub maska :-5/5 Butter toast:-4/5 Overall 4/5
""
Loved every bit of what I ordered. Must try - Toast butter ! Ambience - typical parsi cafe with youth hopping in!
""
Wanted to try irani cafe in pune so i asked my punekar frnd and he tld me about vohuman cafe.....so we went there and tried their bhurji and cheese omelette along with bun maska and nescafe......loved their bun maska, it was the way how i expected tasty and soft and buttery......cheese omelette and bhurji was also really tasty.....but i liked cheese omelette more compared to bhurji......everyone should visit here once in a while!!
The hospitality here at Savya Rasa is exceptional. I had to make make sure I highlight how efficient the staff here is.  I really really enjoyed the Rasam here.  The ban parota with curry is my new comfort food. The curd rice was so tasty and yummy I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from finishing it all.  I can‚Äôt wait to go back and try something more.  Highly recommend.
Visiting Savya Rasa turned out to be a highlight of dining out in this Pune trip. Really high quality food with quality ingredients, mutton with eggplant and string beans was simply divine. They accommodated special requests for ‚Äònon spicy‚Äô dishes for children. Staff was extremely courteous and happy to accommodate outside of menu requests. Look forward to visiting again on our next trip
A very special birthday celebration of my husband at very authentic South Indian place so called Savya Rasa. We have ordered all must try dishes and they all made our evening very tasty.
""
Savya Rasa is located in the koregaon park area, near starbucks coffee house. We recently visited here for having south indian food. They have decorated Christmas tree very beautifully. The entrance of this restaurant gives feels of kerlite home. The restaurant always having waiting do better book your table before visiting.We have given order on dineout app.The ambience of this restaurant is very beautiful. You will find all decorated items on typical style of kerala.The chair and table also from very old style which gives the feels of your grandparents home. They served all menu on banana leaf. We ordered the pallipalayam chicken curry with Appam. Then we ordered chetinad chicken biryani. The food was awesome. We like the typical style of cooking which gives you home made food feeling. The cost we found little costly here. But over all good experience.
This is the place for dates and hangout with alcohol. They the best drinks here. The ambience and sitting is best. You‚Äôll have your own space to spend time with your special one. They also arrange candle light dinner if you want. The place is nice, quite and enjoyable.
""
Prrize is hipped- way too much- can visit once or twice om special occasions!
It was the first time I visited the restaurant. The ambience was really very good. The food was tasty specially the non veg platter which we ordered. It was fun to taste various types of kebabs and tikkas. Prayag Palkar

Service was good. Thanks

Always love food here as well ambience
Sigree is one of the buffet places that I have been visiting, since a long time now. I have liked the experience in most of these visits. The ambience is nice and well spaced. The staff is courteous and warm. You feel at ease here. The starters are well made and I specially like their fish and prawn grilled starters. The last time I visited, Mutton chops were excellent too. Desserts have variety. One can find jalebi, malpua, rabri too in desserts here (Although the last time I visited, we didn't have these in the menu). Recently, soup has been removed from the menu, which is something that I didn't like as the soups used to be great. Their mocktails need special mention. All in all, a nice place to experience buffet spread.
With the amazing decor, mellow lightning, private dining spaces & a vast buffet counter your Weekends are bound to be class apart ‚ú® . Sigree boasts a huge variety of food especially appetizers & desserts! It is popular for their vast array of barbeque starters ranging from paneer to chicken to grilled pineapples & veggies.. They have got something to please everyone's taste buds üòã
Only Pune can have a place like this! Every item on the menu was healthy to the core. Couldn't believe such detoxifying food was that delicious as well. Try their Chocolate bubble for sure!  The ambience was just so pretty. The peace one feels in this place is on another level. Loved everything about this place. My absolute absolute favourite!!
I have lost count of how many times I have eaten at Sante spa but I absolutely love love love the place. I am a functional nutritionist, and I follow a whole food plant based gluten free, sugar free, soy and corn free eating pattern.. and it's not very easy to find restaurants that are safe for me to eat at.. Sante spa is my safe haven. A literal gift from the universe.. not only do I get food that want.. I get food that's super delicious. I have not been disappointed even once. Every single dish I've ordered has been a winner!  That's about the food, but what I love most about Sante is their service. Sonal and the rest of her team will do whatever it takes to ensure your visit is joyful. They have customized my orders no matter how weird the requests seem. And they have always delivered everything with a smile. Plus are highly knowledgeable about every dish on the menu.  I love Sante spa üíïüíï

This is the most gorgeous place I've seen in Pune for sure as it has got everything, the lush green garden with some beautiful plants and trees which will definitely mesmerise you, pretty cabanas, trendy indoor and outdoor seating, coffee and salad bar for fitness lovers, I cant describe how much i love this place, I'm gonna say it guys, yeah this is my favourite place in Pune.  Ambience:- A perfect place for people who love greenery like me, it has got a resort vibe with a trendy and urban twist to it. Gorgeous lighting for romantic dinner, very spacious and huge parking, for me its the best place for a quiet weekend.  Food:- I just had one thing in mind that I do not miss out on anything so we tried almost 1-2 things from every segment they had to serve. This is a pure vegetarian so for vegetarians like me its a paradise, they had trendy beverages which are quite unique. The cappuccino and latte we had was made with almond milk and were lovely. We had Pizzas, sushi which was one of my favourite, dumplings, spaghetti, Thai curry and some lovely desserts. The desserts were the stars they definitely won our hearts with a lovely taste and stylish presentation.  Service:- The service was pretty great, the owner was lovely she made sure we had a good time.  Hygiene:- The place super clean and everything was very carefully in order.  Cost:-There cost is very reasonable and it's worth the visit.  Highly recommended.

Did not like the food at all. Would not recommend it specially vegeterians. Food was really a disappointment. Not worth it. Had heard a lot about this place so always wanted to be here. Never had such pathetic nachos ever. All dishes ordered was a disappointment.
Excellent Food, fabulous ambience and very courteous staff. I visit this place with family bery often to eat different dishes every time and always enjoyed it
""
Would never visit this restaurant ever , the food was pathetic and did not like any single dish , would never recommend anyone to visit this restaurant ever.
Pizza was expensive and not at all good. Pasta was amazing. Will come here again only for pasta. Watermelon mocktail was okayish.
Say cheese puts a broad smile on my face everytime I visit charni road. You talk about the best rolls in town and people will tell you about Say cheese. Its the perfect place for the right fast food you have in mind. However I feel their food is overly priced still customers visit here very often.
Wow i am so happy with the sandwich they make here... Packing perfect.. Melting sandwich..must try and best Veg grill sandwich.. Quantity and quantity awesome Price a bit on higher side.. Sandwich quantity is huge Must try #meltingsandwich..well packed too...order here for sandwiches will order other stuff and update the reviewü§©
"SAY CHEESE IS LOCATED IN CHARNI ROAD NEAR CENTRAL PLAZA CINEMA.IT IS A ROAD SIDE SHOP.  ROLLS,PASTA,PIZZA,MELTING SANDWICH ARE THE FAMOUS DISHES OVER THERE.FOOD IS HYGENIE.THE TASTE OF THE DISHES WAS VERY AMAZING.QUANTITY IS ALSO GOOD.  THE SHOP IS ALSO OPEN IN NIGHT TILL 2 AM.BEST PLACE TO ENJOY WITH FRIENDS.  DO VISIT THE ""SAY CHEESE"" ONCE."
Melting sandwich !!! This place is mainly know for its melting sandwich which costs around 170 bucks for a large one and can be shared in two to three people. Have visited this place many time, would recommend melting sandwich, pasta in pasta and white sauce pasta.
One of the best sandwich i have ever had. We have Order a Home Delivery WHAT WE ORDERED Pasta pink sauce - 9/10 Melting Cheese Sand wish - 12/10 Cheese Garlic Bread - 7/10  This was a total spent worth, filled my tummy and satisfied my cravings. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKED Noodles - Would suggest to have chessy dish here¬† Definitely ordering next time

Shalimar restaurant is located at Mohd. Ali road. This place serves best mughlai dishes in south mumbai. Ambience is very good. Quality & Quantity of food is perfect. Service is excellent.  Staff is very helpful.  Mal pua is holy month of ramzan is the specialty of shalimar restaurant.Overall experience :- Excellent.
Chicken tandoori  No meat in it, not even fresh tandoori , it was not even hot , please give us wat we r paying for , mahnat Ka Paisa hai
Ordered chicken tandoori and there was no chicken meat in that only there was tandori masala all over. Waste of money had to order another thing from other restaurant thrown away chicken tandoori in dustbin and Zomato person didn't helped on it he just said sorry and that's it I lost my money for nothing.
We ordered Nawabi Tikka Pizza , fries and nuggets Should increase the portion Taste 3.5/5 Ambience 4/5 Service 3.5/5 Value for money 3/5 Overall 4/5

We had decided to explore South Bombay and this was our first pit stop. This place is established in 1904 and trust me u ll get the same vibes. The have maintained that originality. Even the bills that u get aren't printed. So you don't need time machine to go back to 1900. Go to kyani. Food was amazing. We ordered sausage + beans + baked egg + fries it was awesome. Chicken samosa , chicken kebab and mutton cutlet all were awesome. Taste was really good. I loved the ambiance. Very reasonable price you can eat alot here.
Perfect place for breakfast. Their kheema with fired egg is to die for.üòç The sausage and the beans was also good. It is a very cozy parsi place to have breakfast.

One busy place for lunch. Be prepared to charge your table with others. The service is quick. I used to visit this place after my shopping in Crawford Market. It's more digital now. I ordered the mutton biryani today. It was sufficient for one person. It had 3 pieces of meat in it. There was raita along with it. The rice was very well prepared. One of the better restaurants in and around Crawford Market.
Place to do visit when u are crazy about nonveg food. The outlet is near cst station. The place serves best food. I had masala papad which was crunchiest. Then in main course had butter naan full of butter with paneer Tikka masala to end meal had chicken leg biryani. The place served hot food with great service.
Hotel is average.No private sitting place. Your table will be shared with outside crowd as well. But food is really yumm. Especially their tandoor roti which is so soft, tender chicken pieces. Very pocket friendly. It is damn cheap if i compare with any other
Food is ok not worth the hype. Their seek kebab is best.
""
The packing was lousy, there was too much leakage, inspite of packing charges paid, delivery took 55mins that was a long wait. Soup portion was small
Food was so stale .
A good place to try a variety of food. Tried their biryani and malpua. Both were very good in taste and the quality was also very nice. Service is also very nice.

Amazing food must visit this place for mughlai and North Indian food
""
The food is really amazing and the ambience is really nice

Awesome ambience and great playlist. Food and beverage options were nice. The taste and presentation of the icecream was great.
Situated at Prime Location. The service is quick. Pooris are average. Oil is filled inside pooris. Raita is really sour. Can be treated as average food junction.
Well I have heard a lot about this place as it is a 172year Old Food Joint but never got chance to try. But today I was near CST station and was feeling hungry as it was during lunch time hours. So the first place that came in to my mind was this place. The place is always crowded as customers rush in a lot.I ordered the Famous 5types Puri along with some Chole and Aloo Bhaji. The 5 puris consist of Normal Puri, Masala Puri , Beetroot Puri, Palak Puri, Paneer Puri. And all the Puris tasted amazing and tasty.The prices are super reasonable and the staff is very friendly and always welcomes you with smile.So this place is definitely and a must try out.
""
Pancham Puriwala is one of the oldest hotels in Mumbai. Generations have passed by but the taste remains the same. Thali + Buttermilk = Best combinationüòç. Make sure you have enough time because the tables are always reserved (on first come first serve basis) hereüíØ

The outlet has a good vibe as we enter in it as it is located at a good locality like CST. The food here is also good as I ordered the chicken amerikano (stuffed crust). The service and ambience here is good.
If you are true pizza lover you must visit this pizza Hut located at cst...  I tried different pizzas of other companies but I like taste of pizza from pizza Hut...  It's a perfect place to chill out with friends and family.... Their service is so fast. The place is so hygienic.  I tried veg overloaded pizza and cheese pizza Both the pizzas were lipsmacking.  Totally satisfied with my order. Should definitely try other pizzas soon.  If you are true pizza lover you should visit this pizza hut once.  Rating Quality : 5*5 Quantity : 5*5 Pizzas : 5*5
Pathetic and super slow service.
Very good service from Bijay !! Thank you
Amazing food... the taste is up to the mark... must try place.. tired most italian food though... yummy... the staff akshay is really polite and generous..
The place is very beautiful can't get over the interior it's just soo pretty. This place is situated near girgaum chawpatty. Food is as delicious as how pretty the place is. I visited there with my friends it's pretty chill place to visit with anyone be family, friends or on a date.. We ordered khow seuy, nachos, Greek salad and lasagna. For deserts we ordered chocolate fondue and blueberry cheesecake. Food tastes amazing and the serving quantity was also good. For drinks we opted for cosmopolitan and sex on the beach which were also perfectly blended. This place is pocket friendly which is the best part. üòç The place is just perfect in all aspects

Bijay served us and he was very courteous. Food was amazing. Will come back for more for sure!

I ordered delivery from here on scootsy. I specifically ordered the mud cake because I had had it before at the restaurant and it had been good and came with a scoop of ice cream. As no details regarding the food are provided on the scootsy app, I also checked their menu (which has descriptions of each dish) before ordering. The price on the menu and on the delivery app was exactly the same. When it came, not only did the cake not come with any ice cream, it proved to be a health hazard as well. When I cut into it with a spoon, there were two small pieces of what looked like the pointed ends of toothpicks. After that I didn't want to risk any injury, and ended throwing the whole of it into the trash. To sum up, charged me the whole amount for a dish that includes ice cream, and didn't give me the ice cream. Didn't bother removing sharp objects from the cake before sending it.
I love visiting here as it serves you the best quality food and is mouthwatering and pocket friendly. Pizza and pasta are finger licking good.

Taste and service, both are below average. Not fault of staff, its a fault of management. Only two servers to handle entire restaurant, they take orders, clean tables(which was not even done in my case), serve orders and make bill too. So many customers walked out due to this kind of service. Won‚Äôt recommend.
I always disliked Tea Villa Cafe. Their food is super average. But the one time I had to step inside this cafe cause there were no other restaurants around and I was starving, they did not fail in disappointing me. Imagine this, it‚Äôs 12.30 in the noon. The waiter tells me they only have coffee and fries. It‚Äôs lunchtime and they only have coffee and fries. Boy, for the sake of the elaborate menu! The service is very poor. I ordered fries and coffee (can you blame me), and they took an eternity in bringing my coffee. (Which came after the fries) What a shame. First, you don‚Äôt have any food back in the kitchen, and then you don‚Äôt even make the coffee quick? The waiters behaved as if they didn‚Äôt know where they were and that they were waiters in this cafe.
BAD TASTE STALE FOOD WENT AFTER LONGTIME REALISED IT NOTHING LIKE BEFORE WASTE OF MONEY ORDER CHIKAN CHILLY WHICH SUPPOSE TO BE THERE BEST BEFORE IT WAS HORIBLE AND STALE N THEY CHARGE ME 400 FOR SAME WE GET BETTER FOOD IN THAT PRICE AND FOR A RESTURANT LIKE THIS CHRAGING THAT HIGH HAVING NO QUALITY OR TASTE
Although I'm quite averse to Chicken Tikka Biryani (I only prefer Dum style) on a regular basis, I had heard quite some praises of the one here. I must say, it didn't disappoint me at all and was quite packed with punchy flavours. Someday if I'm in Tardeo, I would definitely love to revisit and try other cuisines as well.

"Quite a few restaurants in Mumbai fulfil your impromptu hanger pangs without a burning a hole in your pocket. Recently while sprint shopping at brand factory outlet (tardeo) which turned out to be more of a window shopping thereafter me & my best friend had sudden craving for chicken biryani. So we went surfing on zomato where to head for and walked into Caf√© Noorani which is at 5 mins walk from the brand factory outlet. We knew what was in our mind and stomach. So we ordered chicken tikka biryani.  Food:  1>	Chicken tikka biryani ‚Äì Full grain rice properly cooked along with spicy masala and tender chicken pieces completed our dinner. Curd used in the preparation of raita turned out to be a bit sour.  Ambience ‚Äì Don‚Äôt expect it to be wow and fancy. It is kept simple like other ordinary restaurants. A bit of cleanliness is required around the tables.  Service ‚Äì Our order came within a span of few minutes. Staff was humble.  Food ‚Äì 4/5  Ambience ‚Äì 3/5  Service ‚Äì 4.5/5  Good Food Good Mood!!"
Very bad service ..They just wants to take the order .. You order something you get something else.. They ask you to order it again but they take double payment for it ..
‚ú≥Ô∏èAn amazing place with an awesome ambience .Basically its an quite happening place which is located on the 4th and 5th floor Hub town sky bay bhulabhai desai road breach candy .  ‚ú≥Ô∏èService:- The manager and the staff members here are friendly and courteous. The table was managed by Mr. Sameer who was swift in his service and recommended us various dishes. Mr. Chetan who handles the bar made us some delectable mocktails and took our feedback as well. Overall, the serving of the dishes was prompt and the staff here is polite.  ‚ú≥Ô∏èBE WILD:- Mixture of pineapple and dark rum, it was sour, bitter and sweet to taste and was strong too.  ‚ú≥Ô∏èHydrate: An invigorating watermelon based mocktail, also consisting of rose and basil seeds. The circular watermelon balls and leaves, on a stick, for a garnish adds an elegant touch to the drink.  ‚ú≥Ô∏èSUPERFOOD BURRITO BOWL:- It's in amazing dish I love the Lord basically it's a balance meal of veggies, greens, protein and Carbs... It also had this Quinoa, bell peppers tossed in olive oil, red beans and kale .  ‚ú≥Ô∏èPasta Agio Olio: Half cooked Spaghetti tossed in garlic oil with olives and cheese, was again a healthier option than regular creamy spaghetti!  ‚ú≥Ô∏èthe Cheat Day Brownie Sundae with Vanilla ice-cream. Not to be confused with the hot chocolate brownie Sundae, here everything is cold. Served in a cup and saucer and cold chocolate sauce. It tastes fine till you have it with ice-cream, then gets a little monotonous towards the end.  ‚ú≥Ô∏èSpicy guava ice cream Again a winner for me. The ice cream was creamy and the spiciness of red chilli just balanced the sweetness here. What a lovely rather a sweet way to end our dinner here.  Overall we had a lovely evening with super delicious food that pleased our eyes and satisfied our tummy as well. Do visit this place for a super experience.  Follow:- F00DIE-MADDIE ( insthagram)
Its good pet friendly restaurant. Delicious food and courteous staff.

Has Valet parking. If you are planning for weekend, then prebook the tables as the capacity of this hotel would not more than 40ppl
What went wrong? The fact that we were denied a table at 5 pm and 3-4 tables being reserved. As I'm on calorie deficit, I specifically decided to try this place as it wouldn't hamper my food plans. Alas, I went in hungry and came out hangry.
Excellent ambience
A small mighty cafe yet cozy based in the midst of girgaon chowpatty. The food including Italian and Chinese food is to die for. Must try - triple schezwan rice, nacho, mexican pizza, penne pasta and the best amongst all chocolate avalanche. Both quality and quantity of the food is great. The ambience is equally great. A great place to visit with family and friends. Also its budget friendly. Its become my favorite place to dine on weekends.
Its located near wilson college and has waiting over the weekends so try and come out here early. Its very famous among the youngsters and the food out here is value for money. To add to it, its a part of zomato gold so its very light on the pocket. The service is fast and the staff is polite. We had ordered Manchow soup (3/5) Mexican Fajita Wrap ( 4/5) cheese cheese french fries ( 5/5) and cheese corn balls ( 5/5) and were were quite full.
I had tried loaded nachos with my friend at TNBT which was fully loaded vegan nachos with cheese, jalapenos, olives, tomato salsa and Tri color capsicum which was awesome üòãüòã.
The place is really nice. The food is delicious. I had an amazing time with my friends. It's a very cool and comfortable place to chill with family also.
its located just opposite chowpatty. There is always a queue whether its a weekday or weekend so do come early. The ambiance is good and there is also ample seating available. However prices are on a higher side.¬† We had american corn cheese balls ( 4/5), Nachos with beans (4/5), original paneer tikka ( 4/5), new york pizza (4/5) and macroni magic pasta (4/5)
Great taste great service & beautiful ambience.Loved the food & taste was great. Had nachos,blueberry cheesecake shake, Manchurian sizzler, Dahi Kachori it was awesome.¬†  Overall ratings:- 4/5
I love the food. Recently I went there and had the Chole Bhature and loved it. It was a wonderful experience. Enjoyed the sizzler and I love the chocolate brownie sizzler. My friends n me love the place and would definitely be back! Thank you to the whole team of Cream Centre!
Very very very disappointed. I haven't been here since a while. Not since it was recently renovated. I understand a restaurant spends a bit of money to do up a place but then it uses that as an excuse to hike prices, is quite disappointing.¬† A meal for 2 people eating Chana Bhatura costs like 1500.¬† Which is ridiculous from any standard. I didn't have my specs while ordering so just went with the dish which is their speciality and it was a shock to see the bill. The waiters were quite pushy to order more. To add insult to injury the chana bhatura was no where near the one they used to serve before.. The bhatura was dripping with oil and the chana had no taste.. Interestingly the carrot pickle which they have always served saved they day and helped make the food a bit more palatable. But then we didn't exactly go there to eat pickle..

Hi i enjoyed hotel s food and everything the

Lazy service , long waiting time. No value for money. Too expensive for a local restaurant. You may wanna visit a three star with good service & quality food for the same price.
I have visited this hotel before was on my top 10 list of hotels in Mumbai .But on this 2019 31st I had very bad experience . The starter we ordered tandoori lollipop was cold and chicken was not up to mark . We ordered two main course chicken peshavari and mutton anagara both were below average Other time they had served good mutton . Request to hotel management to keep your standard up to mark . I found hotel staff lil bit rude.
It‚Äôs a must go place. Very nice ambiance, been here 2 times taste is too good. Staff is good don‚Äôt take much time to serve even if crowded.
Located in Cubic Mall, Chembur, this place has got lots to offer in every domain possible, be it drinks or appetizers or main courses.  Among the mocktails, we had Kiwi Green Mango and Tropical Cooler. Kiwi Green Mango was so humongous that it literally needed 3 people to finish it.  Tropical cooler was exhilarating as well, with its vibrant colours really adding to the taste.  Lebanese Cottage cheese and Harassi Chicken Skewer were the two starters that we filled our tummies with, with the latter one topping the charts for sure.  Chicken Fajita Sizzler and sizzling paneer were really great, with lots of veggies and stuffings, making it a difficult task to finish.  And last but not the least, New York cheesecake and sizzling brownie really ended a one-to-remember supper at Pot Pourri.  Not to forget the soothing ambience with some light background score, making it just the perfect evening  Notable mentions, Lalji and Ganesh were perfect in their area of expertise.
Was expecting a bowl of pulled pork. Got something that tasted like kanda poha instead.
Looking out for a lovely place to have dinner/lunch with your near n dear ones? Pot Pourri is the perfect place for you.  Its located at chembur, cubic mall on second floor. As soon as I entered it felt so relaxing. Its dark with dim lights and music being played. The staff is very helpful. The seating arrangement is so comfortable accompanied with good background music. A family seating table is also available. They have an amazing bar section as well.  The dishes tried by us: ‚ñ™Classic kitkat shake (highly recommended) ‚ñ™Cranberry lemon ‚ñ™Lebanese chicken and cheese (highly recommemded) ‚ñ™Harissa chicken skewer ‚ñ™Chicken Fajita with rice sizzler ‚ñ™Fish N Chips ‚ñ™Gooey chocolate (highly recommended) ‚ñ™Sizzling brownie  All the dishes had an appealing presentation. The quantity of dishes were sufficient for two. The staff is courteous and they helped me to choose the best. Thank you! Suraj and Lalji for such a great hospitality.  Also on tuesday's they have Buffet dinner at 399/- only. Do visit Pot pourri to experience the best...
Roasted garlic soup was nice and creamy I also added chicken to the soup. Cajun chicken salad was one of the best salads I had. The red wine poached pear was simply amazing. Melon twist was nice vodka based cocktail. The highlight of the dinner was the Peri Peri roast chicken. The chicken was so soft and so juicy and the flavors we're just perfect. The chicken was perfectly cooked the salad and fries were going well with the dish. It's a must have at Pot Pourri. The service was great too.
Stopped by at Kook for a quick lunch with the gang while on our way back from Lonavala. We ordered for a couple of Tandoori non veg starters, manchow soup, kadhai chicken, cheese garlic naan, garlic naan and Gulab Jamun. The food was delicious. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt get a chance to click pictures since we were extremely hungry and tired. But overall the place was nice and cozy with efficient, helpful staff and value for money.
""
The food is having a great taste but the quantity of the food is not upto the mark. As per the price is considered the quantity they serve is very less. The restaurant is with a okay ambience. The plating is the best part of all. The service is also not that good as we have to wait for long time for few dishes. But food was tasty.
""
Another restaurant in chembur which has gone to the dogs. The owner has left it to incompetent staff who dont know how to talk to customers.  Ordered tandoori chicken through swiggy. It was shitty and dry - called them to tell that. The guy debates that what can go wrong in tandoori chicken.  Seriously, the owner should get serious about business or as i can see the place will not go much further. As you will see, its the only place left which is offering zomato gold while other restaurants have pulled off. The key reason is quality of food which is BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I wont order again - my suggestion is you should also skip. Really really sad that i ordered from there and spoilt the mood.!!!

It has a right amount of spices and good enough of quantity Very amazing place great ambiance Very nice and cozy place to chill with friends The food here is good and it's just awesome There are many varieties in the outlet and the service was very fast Polite staff It was a very nice experience for me over there i really love it lovee their services (wow)üòç
I ordered the veg Spaghetti Aglio Olio. It had the right amount of spices and a good enough quantity for one person. The price is a bit on the higher side but they did a good job with the cooking.
Very nice and cozy place to chill and hangout with you mains. The food here is good and the ambience is just too awesome. Nice place for a date or otherwise. Very spacious as compared to other outlet.
2 of us went for dinner at GrandMama's Cafe Chembur and we loved the ambience and the entire vibe of the place. The manager, Mr Firoz and even the person who waited us was very courteous and well acquainted. We tried things from their new menu. We ordered a coke float, which was decent and Potato Bravas to start with. These are deep fried potato balls. They were crispy and soft from inside. Then we ordered Volcano Jumbava for main course. We had no expectations as it was an experiment we were doing. But to our amuse, it turned out to be super amazing. It's basically a pan that comes with indian bread like cover on the top exactly like how a dum biryani bowl would have. There's rice inside with exotic veggies in spicy and kind of tangy sauce. The flavors were just right and it was a legit treat. For desserts we ordered, the Belgium chocolate shake and chocolate mousse. Chocolate mousse was okay but the shake is too good and it's too heavy. All in all, we had a love time at Grandmama's Chembur

The food quality as well as portion is very good. The people are very nice and hospitality is way better than any luxury restaurant.

KFC serves great chicken. That's what it's known for, that's what's best there. The newly introduced Chicken Longer is pretty great and VFM. The buckets have always been good. I'm also fond of the Krushers.
""
I love the ambience of this place... But the food didn't meet my expectations..I wasn't satisfied with the quantity of food served. I suggest the restaurant to increase the quantity of meals, a little bit .
""
Visited the place around 8 in the evening and there was no one to attend us. Most of the table had uncleared plates which made us difficult to look for the table. The restaurant needs a major renovation and deep cleaning as it has dust all around. The layer of dust is so much that i could even write name on it. We ordered Jalapenos Nachos and i found no Jalapenos in it. The order took more than 40 mins which is really big time for a restaurant whith such a high rating. Hope they improve on it.
Just loved the Crispy lotus stem. Absolutely worth spending your money for!

Amazing Momos! Not spicy and just the way you want!
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking to have good, tasty and authentic chinese food. They have a wide variety of options for starters, noodles and rice. I would say do try out their Dragon chicken, burnt chilli garlic rice/noodles, schezwan rice/noodles. Overall I would rate this place as 4/5 on tasty and variety.

Poorly baked pizza with no sense of taste. The toppings and pizza base were badly seasoned. Avoidable.

At the street corner and along with sea view. Great ambience and great location. Bit expensive but probably due to its location. Serves Italian and variants of pizza which also has alcohol content in it. Must visit for sea view . Tried Paneer piccante :pizza made up of paneer olives jalapenos . And the base bread its made up of healthy grains and not of maida. So its good one to try.  Macchiato caldo : expresso shot with milk foam over it served with chocolate cookieüòç
It was a great experience coming here,the ambience is pretty chill and the staff and service is very friendly and good to be around... special mention to krish's pizza and peached iced tea.(a must have)...kudos to ameen and other staff...waiting to come back ...!!

A Memorable experience!  A great rooftop restaurant to take your partner for a romantic date. Courteous waiters welcome you as you enter. You can ask for Nixon, who is one of the nicest waiters around. Mainly choose this restaurant for the sunset view. Also, the staff helped in organizing rose petals and a cake for the special occasion.  Ambience- 5/5 Drinks- 4/5 Food -5/5 View- 6/5  Drinks- We tried Strawberry Daiquiri and Watermelon Bramble. Definitely worth a try ;)  Food- Hummus with pita bread- was okayish. Crispy veggies - Were really yummy Minted cottage pizza- was delicious  Thanks for the evening. Would definitely visit again ;)
I visited Dome last weekend for my first anniversary celebration. I had booked a table for two around 2 days prior but still the staff didn't even bother about it. They gave us a couch very close to kitchen which was really disappointing.¬†  This place is to be best visited for the sunset view hence advice you to arrive a little early before 6.30 PM so that you can settle down and enjoy the view of marine drive along with sunset with a glass of wine :)¬† It's very compact lounge but a really posh one.¬†  We ordered Frateli Sette Red Wine and Rum with some crispy chicken and tandoori chicken pizza. The food menu is really short but up to the mark.¬† Price for 2pax can go around 6K+¬†  Hope you too have a good evening at Dome - Intercontinental
Lets get one thing straight - The views are to die for. It is one of the very few locations in Mumbai where you can spend quality romantic evening with your significant other. The food was decent, and the service was great!. Would be visiting again soon!
Went here for dinner. The best thing about this restaurant is the panoramic view of marine drive. Found it to be a little overpriced. However worth a visit !!
Nixon is very attentive. He made sure we had a fantastic experience.
The ambience is good enough. Waiting period will be more if you are visiting on weekends.¬† Food is tasty, won't regret going in. Staff is helpful.
It has good ambience. Different but interesting interiors. Very famous and crowded especially on weekends. Food is good and liquor is served on wholesale rates. Good crowd with loud music. I liked the place. One of the best restaurant in Dadar with lot of variety in non veg as well veg plus a lot of drinks available there. With friendly environment and well interior fancy designs.This is a place where you can chill with your friends and family. This place have Bollywood theme and plays very good music. Must visit this place. Staff is also very good and gives you best service. I will recommend you.

Located on the top of nakshatra mall at dadar This place has been on my list since it was on Zomato gold. However, when I visited, gold was no longer available here.   The menu is quirky and some very different combinations of food you‚Äôll get here.  There‚Äôs an open rooftop seating area and an a/c seating area.  The staff is polite and courteous. The decor is lit!  They have screenings of live matches here. Music and ambience was very peppy and nice!  We ordered the Chicken tikka Mac n cheese. To our surprise it was really good as compared to the usual Mac n cheese that you get anywhere else. Then we ordered the prawn lapeta dish in main course with roti and paratha.  Food - 4/5 Quality- 4/5 Quantity- 3/5 Cost- 4/5 Service- 4/5 Ambience- 5/5
Not at all clean,staff is not trained,no proper service,
We wanted to catch up for quick drinks in the evening and found this place on Zomato. Very well made vibrant place with friendly staff. They are extremely well priced which is what makes them so popular. the happy hours have even better prices.   The choice of drinks are good, how I wish they had some beer on Tap,  The food has a very good variety and tastes good, however the egg roll was extremely pungent. With all other factors being good this makes a pass for not satisfying our palette.  Do make reservations and note Shorts not allowed
Mrp truly stands for its name all drinks were on MRP i really loved the mrp rates. The food was okay i didnt liked that meat pizza in the pic it was the worst pizza i ever had ambience was decent and even the crowd. Stags were allowed when i went for the first time and when i called someone to book a table again the guy was like no stags and i will let you in only if you look decent otherwise i cant ensure. I dont think that he should say this to anyone or judge him by his voice. I disliked it i went to some other place never coming back.
Mrp is located in Dadar. Ambiance is nice. The food is good and tasty. They have happy hours from 6pm to 9pm for alcohol at a good price. Saturday nights after 9pm you will hardly get place to sit mostly bar area so make sure you are there earlier. The music is good and mostly on weekends they have live music.

"Delicious to the core... Literally everything ordered at this restaurant was ""Oh so good"". We went here on a Sunday night and the restaurant was packed with people waiting outside. We had to wait for almost 45 minutes to get a table, but it was definitely worth the wait. Aaswad has been around since 1984 and is famous for it's Maharashtrain delicacies. We ordered Misal Pav, Vada Pav, Kothimbir Vadi, Sabudana Vada, Rava Dosa and Kulfi Falooda. I practically loved everything. Although my least favourite was their Rava Dosa. The Misal and Vada Pav was bursting with flavours. It was the first time I tried Kothimbir Vadi and this has been added to my list of favourites. I requested them for Garlic Chutney and Coriander Chutney as they were typically serving coconut Chutney with most of the dishes. The Garlic and Coriander Chutney were brilliant and perfect accompaniments for the Sabudana Vada and Kothimbir Vadi. The Kulfi Falooda was sinfully yummy! It also had Sabja and chunks of jelly. The service was prompt as well. Aaswad deserves all the recognition and popularity."
The food was very good. The lamb platter however wasn‚Äôt cooked perfectly. Overall a pleasant atmosphere.
It's fency place with courteous staff. It's all time handout food. Food is incredibly tasty.

Few days back I visited this place to try out their new menu which I must say is very impressive. Location:- This place is located just few mins away from Dadar Location. It is situated at one of the prime locations in Dadar. Ambience:- This place is gonna remind you of your grandmama's place that is for sure. Vintage Ambience and Vibrant Colours Perfect combination. What We Had:-1)Citrus Blue 220:-  It was served in a beaker with soda. The colour was blue. 2)Massive Chocolate Breakout  As the name suggest it was a shake which was massive in size. A must try for all chocolate lovers. 3)Grand mamas Special Pizza:-it was a veggie loaded thin crust pizza with lots of cheese on it 4)The chocolate ball:-As you grandmama won't allow you to leave her place without eating dessert, this place definitely makes sure you won't leave this place without trying their most recommended dessert i.e Chocolate ball
Grand mamas cafe  No need for an auto. Walking distance peh hai. Station seh 5 min  We choose to sit-in üòÇ Just because the interior was fab¬†  What we had:- 1)Citrus blue 220 Like the idea playing as if it was a chemical. Served in bada wala beaker üòÇ thought as if it was ice cream but then there was more to add on. I‚Äôll rate this thing 4.5/5 2)Massive chocolate blackout 340 So the moment this came I loved it! Everything was perfect except those 2 waffles.  The whipped cream on top was awesome. Name itself says massive chocolate !!!!  I‚Äôll rate it 5/5 3)Grand mamas special 410  It was a thin crust pizza with lots of exotic veggies over it. I totally loved it. I'll rate it 4.5/5 4)The chocolate ball 310 I loved it. Any chocolate lover would die for this bcuz at first it was a small golden ball üòÇ  but the moment you taste this you'll love it  Ball k niche there‚Äôs one think chocolate donut! I‚Äôll rate this 5/5chocolate lover would love it )   The service was very prompt and the staff was helpful in selecting dishes.  Overall a great experience.  A Must Try Place In Dadar

I visited Home chef recently. Its a cute little small cafe and i loved the ambiance. It has a small bakery inside. The food is food here. Had the coriander chicken chilly and it was flavorful and good in taste along with mojito it went a perfect match. Also i had panner steak with mushroom sauce along with mashed potato and grilled veggie on a healther side. It turned out to be amazing and i had it with hot chocolate which was chocolaty and thick enough. Lastly i had just a chocolate strawberry fresh pastry. It was good.
"Hey there All Visited this Amazing Place known as Home chef a couple of days Back very decent place with vibrant Colour Walls Heard these place serves the best Pizza & shakes & guess what the place lived up to the hype We were Duo The very first thing we ordered was Shakes 1) Strawberry Shake 2) Black Forest Cake Shake Gotta tell you guys strawberry shake was bud blowing ! It was thick & creamy (highly Recommended) Black Forest Cake Shake was very Unique We could literally taste the black forest in the shake without Cream loved it too In Appetizers ) Crispy Chicken ) Chicken Chilli Corrinder Crispy Chicken is an all time favourite dish of everyone but over here it's different here crispy chicken is not in Dry form over here it's ""Fried"" It's like a Kfc style Chicken It was Amazing (highly Recommended) Chicken Chilli Corrinder is huge chicken strips tossed in Corrinder sauce with fried noodles it was good & slightly spicy In Mains )Chicken Popcorn Punch pizza )Chicken 65 Burger Chicken Popcorn Punch pizza is 9 inch üçï The topping are popcorn fried & loaded with mozzarella Cheese highly Recommended Guess all time Favourite dish of Home chef ""Mean while something strange thing happened .3 girls came in restaurants and they started ordering the waiter told her not to order now they said why then the waiter said after 5 mins 1+1 will starts which means happy Hours of home chef (4 pm to 7pm) where you can get 1+1 a very sweet Gesture of the Waiter Kudos to him"" Chicken 65 Burger was massive it was very difficult to finish it we were struggling the patty of the chicken was made in 65 sauce it was mild spicy .Served with some fries & creamy cabbage In Desserts choco Chip Pastry Royal Choco moussee Both the pastries are in house pastries Both were delicious in taste i would recommend Royal Choco Moussee"
Hey there! Craving for Some italian food ? Hell Yeah! this is the correct place for it From Pizza's to pasta everything available They have Happy hours from 4 to 7 where u can get 1+1 pizza & burgers Visited Couple of days Back tasted Strawberry shake ,crispy chicken & chicken 65 burger Quality & quantity of the food were splendid ! Crispy chicken was different it was like kfc fried chicken served along with Mayo chicken 65 burger was very big & was amazing in taste. Strawberry shake of home chef is on different level it has became my all time favourite shake
Visited this cafe at Dadar and a good place to hangout. More like a chill place and would recommend this for coffee and pasta and pizzas. Tried few of their items:- ‚Ä¢Kitkat shake ‚Ä¢Pineapple cake a shake ‚Ä¢Chicken popcorn ‚Ä¢Fire cracker sausages ‚Ä¢Stroganoff Chicken ‚Ä¢Stuffed grilled chicken steak I would recommend the cake a shake the chicken popcorn and the fire cracker sausages.
Home Chef  ‚Ä¢Kitkat shake Had a very thick consistency had a little extra sweetness overall a good one but after a while its heavy to drink. ‚Ä¢Pineapple cake a shake A pineapple shake made of a pineapple pastry. This was sweet good consistency and would definitely recommend this one. ‚Ä¢Chicken popcorn Small chicken popcorn deep fried to perfection. Had a crunchy layer on the outside with soft chicken beautifully cooked on the inside. I would recommend this has a starter as the quantity is good as well. ‚Ä¢Fire cracker sausages Chicken Sausages tossed in with bbq sauce, chilli flakes. This is also their speciality. It tasted really good and would recommend this. ‚Ä¢Stroganoff Chicken Creamy mushroom & gherkin veloute, fries and rice. This was a little pale kinda dish. As its a cafe this place best suits for coffee, pizzas and pastas. This dish was more like a try the cafe is giving. Not upto the mark but you can give it a try. ‚Ä¢Stuffed grilled chicken steak With mushroom ragout, garlic mash, veggies and toast. I would say the same to this as I said to tej above this. The steak was good but the mushroom ragout was not upto the mark. The garlic mash was okayish not a big fan.

Went there to chill on a Friday night and to indulge on some coffee and waffles. Ordered the Chicken Junglee Sandwich which turned out to be quite decent. And then ordered the Roasted Almond Waffle which was so below par. The bread or the base was absolutely stale and literally not edible. Told the manager about the same and he didn't bother about it, gave a bizarre explanation that it's freshly made and bla bla. I went there, especially for the waffle but it turned to be a very very disappointing experience.
Nice place to have coffee near Dadar Chowpatty. Ideal for a date at a central locale. Nitro cold brews are good. I recommend this place.

Taste is ok but too much low in cheese it was dry not worth it as compared with price..
After trying all the big brands like Domino's, pizzahut, Joey's etc I wanted to try something different and cheeza point was highly rated on Zomato.  So I ordered:  VEG TRIPLE SPICY PIZZA with buttery pan crust base for extra amount and honestly I was comparing it with the big brands and cheeza Point wasn't upto the mark. They definitely are trying to get there and kudos for the efforts but the base felt like it was a normal base nothing special and the so called triple spicy pizza wasn't spicy at all had a sweet barbecue saucy taste which was a disappointment.  CHEESE GARLIC BREAD : The garlic bread had a great taste however the cheese that was infused inside had gotten very hard and it was nearly impossible to eat it. Liquid cheese would have done a better job. However due to this the garlic bread didn't taste good and was quite mediocre.  Overall this place is trying to put all its efforts but they aren't still there when compared to the taste however they are almost as expensive as other big brands. But if you are bored of the same old pizza's Cheeza Point is offering some new flavours and more also Zomato gold works here so you can avail the second dish for free.  Overall rating - 3
This how they deliver your pizza the quality of package is so bad that the you cant even eat that pizza this second time iam ordering form this same restaurant and i cant even eat this thing great job chizza point you just lost my trust never order any pizzas from this restaurant
Their pizza is delicious and has a good quality in products used for toppings also quantity is less but taste is preferable
Domino's Pizza of Vira is best pizza  The outlet of Domino's are simple and good  Ambience are simple and nice looking  We oder panir pizza and chicken pizza both are make perfect and testy  The service are fast and staff are friendly  Cost of two people is 500  Overall all the best experience of Domino's Pizza  Thank you Domino's Pizza
The chicken is really yummy my favourit is chicken over here my favourit in soup is chicken manchow soup its really tasty in starer chicken tandoori its very much tasty and yummy and chicken crispy is very yummy and in main course butter chicken is really very delicious and tasty

Mutter paneer a must try for all vegetarians .......smokey flavour........mouth watering gravy.....ordered 2 to 3 times overalll........taste exactly the same everytime...!!
I order Butter chicken and garlic Naan from here. My review about butter chicken is that, the gravy was ok but chicken pieces were fresh, juicy and well marinate. thumps up for that. Garlic naan turn me off due to raw garlic taste. Rest over all taste was good. Will order again for this restaurant :) Thank you Brijesh for quick Zomato Delivery.
Just had Dal khichdi from here and I liked it alot. Proper taste the way I wanted. Little spicy. Good quantity. Best till what I had.
Mahi gives best service us... and all staff are very polite and humble
The service of Mahi and tapovan was grtüëåüëå...they were very helpful and cooperative....i loved their services and the foods also

Some chicken chunks for my evening snacks!! . We visited Hunger Villa that serves Italian, Continental, North Indian & Desserts. The caf√© is small but has a good ambience. It‚Äôs a perfect place to hang out with your friends and it's situated in the prime location.   In frame:  Dynamite Chicken!! Batter fried crispy chicken chunks served with spicy & tangy sauce. The chicken tasted good but at the same time, there was nothing special in it. Also, I found the rate on a higher side for this simple dish.  Price: Rs. 249/- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . #dynamitechicken #hungervilla #loveforchicken #eveningsnack #starters #virarcafe #goodbutnotthebest #instapic #keepeating #vasaifoodie #lovetoeat #enjoylife #livetoeat #foodiesaboard

Kolsa Restaurant is one of my fav restaurant. Chicken dishes were too good here, Specially Khepsa Rice.. It was delicious..!!
Non veg
We ordered methi matar malai , oh my god it was the worst worst worst experience. methi matar malai is such a delicious dish , but they ruined it beyond imagination.
Good Place for Chill Out
Food is not really good!!!
Overall good experiance
""
It took them 20 minutes to get 2 pints of tuborg. Also, 30 mins later we came to know that order placed was incorrect. Very LOUD live music I literally had to shout to talk with my colleagues..üòï
Staff knowledge is ok. Mutton Jeera was far below expectation. The Mutton was full of fat and bone. Bombil Tawa fry, the fish was fresh however we realized it was from deep freezer as the fish was not cooked from the center. No accompaniment provided along with the fish. I will still give one more try to this placeand I hope the management and culinary team will work on the shortfall in coming days.
""
I ordered chicken dumplings üòã..it was best & tasty..!! Try this
One of the worst do ever had in Virar... Manchow soup--colour--dirty muddy water Noodle--dry/old/smelly Rice/manchurian-over salty.... . Total yucks... . Won't be surprised if this restaurant closes in few days... . Horrible

One of the most highly recommended restaurant to try on with friends and family their ambience is a whole vibe with joyfull lights and colours also food taste and service is best with good quality and heart whelming dishes always a treat at this place trying atleast for once is worth youll never regret!!!!
Mind blowing ambience Good for couples I had ordered veg crispy burnt garlic fried rice kulfi falooda According to the price qty was superb Kulfi falooda is dish u must try fir dessert But negative part their tandoor is closed between 3 pm to 7 pm so u cannot order tandoor dishes
This is the best place in virar to go if you are confused about the resto's. I've tried everything over here and the food is just amazing. Be it veg or nonveg it has to be great! This place has amazing butter chicken and daal khichdi if you ever wanna try this combo. You should definitely go for it atleast once.
The theme of this restaurant and bar is different and entertaining. Good food and service. Really like their complimentary pan shots. Must visit!

One of my more preferred places to spend a chilled out afternoon having lunch near my office. Prawns here are so tasty. Lovely ambience. Good service and food portions are more than enough for one person.

Great service by ravinder Singh . Achio mutton kadai was fab.
With the hype heard about the place, me and my husband had them on our must visit pub in Mumbai. It did change once we were there, the food was good but we had a very high expectation on the cocktails... Turned to be a nice experience but not the best. Good place to visit one time at least for the hype.
We were refused to pay from zomato. We could have easily save 2K if they would have allowed as per the offer they show in the app. We were denied by the steward Mr Ravindra singh
One of the best party i had. An awesome night with all the colleagues. Had gone to this place for my office party and this place was just too awesome. The bar counter was also very good and the staff was courteous and kind to all of us. The starters was delicious and also the food was good. The DJ rocked the night. This lounge is enough for a big crowd to accumulate and have a great time. Had a great time and also wish to visit this place again very soon.

"One Monday evening, say about 8ish, I craved for sushi. And then what, googled the closest, trendiest, latest asian place and voila popped ""plum"" by Bent Chair.  What i ordered - salmon nigri (4pieces) - no complaints 5/5  - Shanghai pork dumplings - blew my mind!!! It was like soft pillows of porky goodness that sat in a balsamic vinegary broth...salivating while even writing this. highly higlhy recommended 10/5  - garlic buttered fried rice with edamame - Stingy on edamame but more than generous on the flavour. Lip smacking could eat just this without anything. Great accompaniment for your main 5/5  - golden fish steak (plum speciality) - oh yeahh! Fresh fish, great crunch, deliciously succeed sauce. Was the most expensive out of all the dishes we ordered but was totally on point. 5/5  - 2 beers - had a terrible throat so requested for a less chilled one (don't judge) and they obliged.  - bonus*** you get a basket of sweet Thai spiced crisps with an array of delicious dips..go crazy  The entire bill was 3338 (with tax). I paid on Zomato gold and got a whopping discount and ended up paying only 2500 for two . I say it's a steal"

This place is everything you wanna post on Instagram about. From decor to food to it's unique name. Had visited this place today had really great experience. But it's a small place not enough to accommodate large crowd as it shares its maximum space with Lord of the drinks. The food here is excellent .From pizzas to spicy fired rice everything was just brilliant. Would definitely love to come back here. The only problem was that the staff was really slow had to wait for a while to get our food but I totally understand because the place was fully occupied. Food-5/5 Ambience-5/5 Staff-4/5 Overall-4/5
We've been meaning to visit plum for a while now It's a very well done up place with super interiors but I wouldn't recommend it for food or alcohol as such. Half the wine they had on the menu wasn't available, I asked to taste the black tower which we ordered and they served us the two oceans instead saying it was the same one we tasted! I let it go because it's a decent wine and thinking since most of the wine on the menu ia not available they would serve similar priced wine. Anyway, the brunch menu is very limited and nothing exceptional, we ordered lots of sushi, dim sums, salad etc all of which tasted very average.  On the way out, we liked a few art pieces which was available for purchase, so my friend decided to buy two of them. Unfortunately the staff there has zero clue about the prices etc as apparently all the prices mentioned are very old and need to be updated, so they just randomly decided to increase the price of what we bought after speaking with the store manager. After the long wait we just left, not sure if we were even going to be billed for it. The staff seemed completely clueless about everything there.  Great art pieces but badly managed, slow service and clueless staff won't make me want to go back for sure!

Only thing I liked about this place is the vibrant decor and the vibe.  So i ordered four cheese pizza, which i recieved not hot but cold and it had no taste. The sauce was Bland af.  Also ordered the penne pesto pasta. Which was dry and was floating in oil at the bottom of the plate.  Nothing much to brag about with the food.
Wel just love this place  A great cafe in Kamla mills to hang out with A brilliant idea by impressario group by Riyaz amlani  By getting all kiosk food trucks and bar together  This place also has live bands  Good food  I really like the prawns dimsums here  The chicken dumplings were ok  I tried the chicken chilli was was really good  The best was Lucknow tunde kabab a good combination with their paratha  the prawns tempura sushi was also good in taste  the drinks are served by their in-house brand Social so the name says it all Over all a good place for a evening
Had an amazing time here ! Super cool Ambience and super delicious food, especially the nachos and butter chicken üòâ Would sure recommend this.
I'd been there once and my experience was really amazing. Vibe/servicing/food/music everything was on point. The ambience was something I really adored and I'd love to come again soon.
Talaiva is located at one of the most lively and happening places at Kamla Mills in Lower Parel. The drinks are great and the food is even better. The ambiance is great and absolutely loved the music. Location: 5/5 Ambience: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Value For Money: 4/5 Overall: 4.5/5
Good place to hangout with friends.dance floor is nyc.recommended for weekends. Food is good. Good ambience. Nyc experience. Recommend if u r music lover.
Its a great place for partying and happened to visit the place for an office party. The music was a good mix of desi and English stuff. The food quality is great and cannot be better. For alcohol, the pricing is on higher side, but considering the location that is expected to be.  All in all it can be a great place to have fun, hog, drink and shake a leg!!! Kudos guys!!!

We had decided to check out this place because of the high rating on zomato and were very surprised to find the place cramped in terms of seating. The food was average. Paneer starter that we ordered was bland and had no salt. The main course was slightly better but nothing to rave about. I don't think it merits the high rating it receives on zomato yet. One good thing about the place was that our head waiter was very cooperative and helpful and we got a good discount on the food bill because of zomato gold. They definitely need to up the food quality if they want to get better ratings. One shouldn't go on the overall food rating is the lesson we learnt.
If you're going out for dinner then this is an average Punjabi restaurant. Probably the high ratings are for the drinks. The name of the restaurant makes you feel you're going to some special restaurant with some special l, funky dishes on the menu. It was disappointing to see that almost all of the menu (vegetarian side at least) was made up of your regular Punjabi fare that you'll find in so many restaurants of Mumbai. The food itself was good. But don't even think of trying the Vada pav fondue. Epic fail. I think they should take it off the menu. They also had loud dancy music like a pub should have where people come to party and more for the drinks and less for the food. But that didn't seem to be the case here on a Thursday so the music seemed out of place.
It was my birthday and choose this amazing place to celebrate and was quite an amazing decision . Full points to the food quality , quantity and the hospitality . The guys here are really sweet . Ordered Chicken Popcorn - the quantity was amazing and the chicken quality was too good and tasted delicious . Grilled Chicken burger - it was huge and delicious served with generous amount of fries loved the burger . Spaghetti Aglio e olio - loved the quantity and taste .  Also ordered 2 glasses of Sula Merletüòãüòã Would really recommend this place to anyone who wanna spend some amazing time with some lip-smacking food. . Keep serving delicious food‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

I have been going to this place from a long long time probably 10-12 years... This place use to be a great open to sky restaurant.. But I have seen a drastic drop down in food quality and poor service from the hotel... Few years back we use to say let's go to aarey restaurant but now if someone says let's go there then I have to think twice before saying yes... Last night I was there with my friends to have dinner and the kind of service we got was really pathetic... Food was not even 3/10 My friends had ordered chicken triple shezwan fried rice and surprisingly there was no chicken in the rice the only chicken present in the dish was in the gravy... And to top it up the staff tried to defend it as yes we put bolied chicken but it could be in less quantity... On asking the staff to show any piece of chicken in the rice then they said sorry sir our cook is gone otherwise we would have given u another dish which was worst we just wanted them to know that the quality is poor portions and not right and service is not up to the mark... Even the chicken pieces in the gravy had hell lot of corn flower which was not even cooked properly.. The only dish I was happy with was veg oriental rolls... Butter was missing on the butter roti.. Height was such that one starter came with the main course... üò° I am highly disappointed with all of this and when we asked them for the bill and complaint book they just gave me a suggestion paper where I couldn't even write my suggestion.. I strongly recommend the aarey restaurant owners and management people to see in to the restaurant more as it's a service industry and if u keep on giving such service people will stop coming there....
Nice, gentle and attentive service. Food is awesome, 0 complaints. Also they deliver till 2 at night. Overall one of the best.

I had Order from here Chicken Deep Fry 250grms Very good Quantity Very Good Quality And very taste. Fastest Delivery as well... Rating 5/5
This is the closest to me and I have been ordering from here since a while now. Their delivery is very quick. Tried their Arabic shawarma and special chicken shawarma. Lip smackingly good. The quantity is good, generous hummus, tastes incredible. Good going!
Chinese hong Kong noodles with cashews worst combo, Worst food, tasteless, dont even try. Also not healthy full of oil. And bad service providing vague menu names.
I never thought I would like hummus in my life but these guys makes fresh creamy one * situated in far land of Arrayüöï one point I thought we are going out of Mumbai but good food takes you every were...üöÄ * small joint with good staff and service * decided to parcel and eat at home * Pita bread and hummus was yummmy yumm‚úå *paneer shawarma was tasty, with loads of Paneer along with it was pickle of beetroots and cream which compliment shawarma like bestee üë´ * value for money * can pay by paytm * if you like food and can go anywhere for it please try And those who live near and can get home delivery I envy you...üòè
Recently opened in Royal Palms- as always, I am wary of places which open up here as they are generally sub standard. Ordered a fried rice and Shawarma. Surprisingly was not at all bad. Both were good - quality and quantity wise. Unlike other places, they delivery pretty fast as well Edit- awesome shawarmas...good variety and quality at good price
It's been few months now that I am ordering food from here. I order from here twice or thrice a week. I love their shawrmas and have tried all veg Chinese starters and to be honest they are amazing. The quality of food is just amazing , the best thing about them is their delivery time . food is at your doorsteps in 15-20 mins also it's hot and fresh. Also the quantity they serve is good. Staff is good specially the kid who sometimes dilevers at my place.   Giving them 5.0 rating because they deserve it.
The restaurant's numbers have been out of service for more than 2 two months now but zomato still shows they are open. The food was great till they were delivering. The restaurant doesn't seem to exist now.
Ghar ka khaana vaala taste! Excellent rajma‚ù§
This place serves the best north indian food . Their Rajwa , chole, kadi pakora are so tasty with balanced spices. I bet this food will never be heavy for our tummy .I can eat their food every other day . food is hygenic, well cooked and reasonable too. Good work .
This place serves the best rajma, properly cooked and parathas are just like my mom used to make amazing I already suggested so many people to try food sutra
This place is my staple for almost every other day! Their Rajma and Chole are authentic and light, and Sarao ka saag, Makke ki roti and Nimbu Shikanji is to die for! Also recommended is their Alu-dum and paratha combo, and lassi!
Wonder cakes A decent cake shop . Cakes here are good , spongy and well baked. The prices are very low as per the quality . They also serve puffs, muffins, pastries, pattices etc Overall food is good service is nice  Food-4/5 Ambience-3/5 Service-3/5
The name says it all.. Wonder cakes are indeed wonderfulüòç The cake looks delicious and tastes delicious too. Everyone should try these wonder cakesüòç YumYumYumüòã
Just a few words to let you know how delighted my mother in law n father in law was to get a birthday cake on their special day. The best part is how delicious they said it was!!!! Thank You so much for your professionalism.Birthday cake was delivered perfectly. I absolutely will use your wonderful and needed service again and will spread the word. Thank You also for being affordable. I am so very grateful to you... ‚ÄúYou are AWESOME!
I ordered cup cakes n birthday cake for my office function. Cakes are having attractive garnishing, fresh n softness & main thing.. Delicious taste... It makes my office treat truly awesome & but obvious something different...I will recommend to try once...will SURELY have it again & again...
can someone pls post the correct number ? - the number mentioned here is a wrong one. It goes to someone else. no online ordering available ?
Very pathetic service providers. First they will promise you everything and then deliver nothing. I simply asked to mention the total calories and macro nutrients breakdown, in response to which they mentioned that it will be provided. Never really got it till date. Meals arrive at irregular timings, so not helping. Also, once you have paid them for the meals, then if you try calling their Co-ordinator, he simply doesn't answer the call even when you call him multiple times. Don't make false/fake promises.
Your Phone is not working.. Tried calling several times but coming that this number temporarily out of service. Would like to know the new number to try your salads.
The concept is amazing... having ordered a couple of times I must say that the food is delicious moreover one doesn't have to worry about my calories intake keep it up .....maintain the standards
This is a great relief for traveling people. I was on the move to Mumbai and wanted to continue with my health plans. Eat2shred solves this problem perfectly with calorie counted healthy meals. I can be eating healthy even on the move.
Happened to visit this place today afternoon.. pathetic waiters.. no manners.. we ordered for chicken biryani.. biryani was damn cold.. no taste .. instead waiter started arguing and said we serve food like this... PLEASE DO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE EVER.. very unhygenic..
Will never recommend this place to anybody coz they fleeced me...read on to know what happened with my second order !!  I recommended zomato to add bambai tadka here and I see that they've accepted my suggestion which is good for the restaurant  Anyway I happened to find this resto one day while I was on a walk, it used to house another resto earlier, I don't know if the owners changed or whatever it is but this new place was well lit and pretty neat. So I happened to take their menu card and ordered twice  First time I ordered their basic chicken fried rice and chicken chilly The rice was good for the price I'd say, it was just 110 bucks, that's about the cheapest Chinese I've ever seen in Mumbai now, I doubt if you get food for that price anywhere these days, apart from the roadside stalls But then chilly chicken wasn't good..chicken was less and the outer covering was very thick, I don't appreciate that, worst part was that they had a lot of capsicum added onto it, it was mostly just capsicum so that again isn't done, the price was I believe 150 bucks which is decent   Now comes the disappointing part, my second order..last week  or so So my parents were at home and we decided to order a full tandoori chicken And I've never had tandoori chicken that's as bad as this one...first of all, the quantity was abysmally low, the guy said it would suffice for 6 people but it wasn't even sufficient for 3 of us The guy who delivered told me it was a full chicken but it obviously dint seem so even when he delivered it in a small packet which by the way was open ( what the fuck ? )...I told him this wasn't a full chicken but he obviously didn't budge What could be worse ? It tasted like shit..because pieces were actually shit..no good pieces..no proper meat..horrible taste...and lots of bones This is just total fleecing which is just not done Unfortunately given the circumstances that day, I couldn't take pics and as such I wasn't expecting zomato to add bambai tadka here so I thought it was pointless anyway  So if you want cheap Chinese, you can order from here but if you're looking out for tandoori or something similar, then please don't  If at all the restaurant cares and happens to see this review, don't you ever fool customers like this
We were four and visited this place on a Monday. It was quite busy despite that. There was hardly any place for walk-in customers, hence I would recommend reserving your table.  We had ordered Fully Loaded Nachos, Pizza Con Le Verdure Arrosto, Penne Pasta in pink sauce and Chili Garlic Noodles.  Fully Loaded Nachos : 4/5 The lot of us who went usually avoid beans, but the beans mix below these nachos delighted our taste buds. The nachos were crispy as well and the cheese sauce was amazing, too. They would provide extra cheese sauce on request. Do try this one!  Pizza Con Le Verdure Arrosto: 3/5 This was a thin crust pizza loaded with veggies, with the cheese suiting the taste. It was quite good, however it can be skipped.  Penne Pasta in pink sauce: 4/5 This had a balanced combination of the tanginess of red pasta and creaminess of white pasta. It isn't a must try, but we loved this dish.  Chili Garlic Noodles: 4/5 These were top notch! It was just as spicy as needed to relish it. Definitely recommended for chinese lovers!  The service was not proper considering they charge a 10% service charge. We had to call for them and they weren't attentive enough. However, one can opt to not pay for it.  We used Zomato Gold and hence found this place moderately priced. It might be costly for a few people not availing Gold.  It is a place to be tried at least once. We would consider visiting again and trying more of the items on menu.

Good restaurant in fun republic mall. Lots of family crowd and groups. All vegetarian and no alcohol.  What we ordered and ate:  1. Spicy guava: 4.3/5 Chilli powder was sticking and not mixed well. Taste was okay.  2. Paan mint mocktail: 5/5 Best of best. This one is a must have. Such refreshing and full of flavors burst.  3. Italian smooch: 4.3/5 A mix of coke, lime juice, ginger and mint. You can try this new combo.  4. Paneer chilli with oyster sauce: 5/5 Very soft paneer and very tasty.  5. Penne pasta pizza: 5/5 Cheesy penne pasta spread on thin crust pizza. Good in taste and filling.  6. Chocolate mud pie: 5/5 This one is a must have and the making of it at your table is worth ordering it.  My rate card: (out of 5) Ambience: 4.5 Service: 4.7 Taste: 4.5 Food options: 4.7 Location: 4.7 Value for money: 4.4  Overall: 4.4  For more food and travel stories follow instagram.com/nikkis_foodntravel
I went to Vedge which is a vegetarian restaurant (no shit, it‚Äôs in the name) and although I would have been disappointed otherwise, I actually really enjoyed it because the best part about Vedge is how innovative they are with their dishes. The first picture is of their highlight dish. I don‚Äôt remember the name but these nachos are the ‚Äòit‚Äô dish so the waiter will know what you‚Äôre talking about. One of the best nachos I‚Äôve had. The next is the Bruschetta Platter with four different kinds of bruschettas. Ideal for a group of people. Cooked well. The Animal Fries were a clear disappointment. As is obvious by how they look. The fourth was the Upturned Pizza Pot Pie which, apart from being scrumptious, was also filling and so creative in the way it was cooked. If you‚Äôre vegetarian or even if you‚Äôre not, Vedge is one place you must visit for the lovely lighting and ambience, efficient service and the oh-so-good food!
The place has a good ambiance for a dinner with friends and family. The staff is proffesional and polite. The food is decent and the portion served is sufficient. Dishes: Burnt chilli basil noodles- Rating: 3/5 1. The noodles were extra thick and average. 2. White sauce Pasta- Rating: 4/5 The pasta was good with loaded cheese. Overall its a decent place to visit.

Had good experience
A very beautiful place. We really enjoyed the ambience. It was quiet perfect for our date. Well, however the food was good. Not great. Especially the quantity of the food could be more. But we really loved the tiramisu cake. And when you do go here, definitely try this cake. It is very soft and delicious. It melts in your mouth. Pi is a good place to chill. It has zomato gold which makes it affordable. Apart from the quantity of the food, over all it was good experience
Aweeeesome place with aweeesome food  Very courteous staff  A must try

I went to the main branch in Delhi thereby I was excited when Moonshine opened in Mumbai. I liked the ambience and I really liked the open area. It was huge and nice ambience. The staff was friendly.
Been here a couple of times and this place is always full of¬†good vibes. Good ambience, good music and excellent food. 1st time went there with my wifey dear and grooved to the latino beat and some great music being played. What helped was Brazil - Nigeria soccer match was on¬†that day. Next visited with a foreign client being¬†early in the week it was a bit quite but all in all we had a good time. Cheers ! will surely visit again.
Looks are deceitful. It looks so classy in the pictures but in reality it's a dull place and the ambience is equally dull. The music was terrible which totally brought our energy down. It's a conversation breaker. We lost track of conversations and I was endlessly yawning. The alcohol options were ridiculously expensive and the staff was not welcoming enough
Moonshine was on my list since a long time, I ended up going there for my birthday celebrations and loved every moment of it! Amazing place with great interiors, their rooftop seating gives a cool and cony vibe. Music and hospitality were perfect. Not only this their food tasted beyond great. I would trade anything for their Daal Makhni tarts üòç. In short if you are looking forward to party or just hang out, Moonshine Cafe and Bar is the place to be! Service: 5 stars Food: 5 stars Value for Money: 5 stars Serving size: 5 stars
This is a perfect party environment with elegant ambience. Rooftop seating available. Very comfortable and spacious seating along with good selection of music will cheer you up. Friendly staff who recommends tasty food. Wide selection of cocktails and mocktails available. Chocolate chip fudge brownie was my favorite amoung all the desert items.  Ambience - 5/5 Food - 4/5 Quantity - 4/5 Service - 5/5 Variety - 4/5 Value for money - 4/5
Was here recently with a few friends. We ordered 2 pizzas, one was a basic cheese one and the other was called Giovanese or something like that. Pizzas were okay, didn't impress. Was hoping for more flavorful options from the place. Mayve next time!
Worst place I have ever gone

As it is located in veera desai area,andheri and i live nearby.i just thought to come and visit this place with my friends .the place is just beautiful with a cozy,peaceful atmosphere.the ambience had some crazy speaker sort of place for barstand which was preety cool and had 10-15 sittings.the dj there had some cool music playings which made our mood and mind really bussed in the place.the staff was up to the mark making sure we were totally comfortable.when we were having our cocktails and appetizers.tipsy gypsy had arranged some live singing there.the singers were just too good.they sang some really good music and the vibes they created made us have our feets tapping and singing. the food and drinks we had there were:- For cocktaills we had the basanti and the delhi ka thug.these two were the best there.just as the name basanti had the spicy(karari)blend.the delhi ka thug was just perfect with the ingredients added correctly.if ur coming to visit this place.u shudnt miss these too.the liit bull and the sexy beach liit were chillin and dizzed us in their taste and were just as their name(liit). For mocktails we had the tropical blast which was nice.talking about the fruit iced tea it was one of the best mocktails i had ever tasted,the sweat and the sour taste made it the best combo.the mint,peelsof orange,lime made it worth having. For food we ordered the drums of heaven,as its name it was truely from heaven.the chicken was too good with the chefs key ingredients sauce made it too good to be true.it was just amazing.it is worth trying.the kasundi fish was also smokin good had that typical taste in it.another work of was the cheese quesadilla it was descorated beautifully.not only looked good but also tasted on top of the world.the indian treat pizza with that thin crust and cheese and paneer craved was also a treat to us.the deconstructed samosa with the masala gravy on top of it was delicious.for typical indian vegans the bombay xpress tawa pulao was intrically amazing and had that bombay styled in it. For deserts the brownie with ice cream was a brownie topped with chocolate and chocostick was a blast.the waffle with chocolate and banana servings was also a mouth watering desert.had to say these two deserts were the best i had ever tried. overall the place had some very good cocktails,mocktails,appetizers and desserts.

Ambience and the staff are really good ! The only thing I didn‚Äôt like is the Chinese.  So if you may go to this place for  drinks, starters and music and not for main course

Visited Lord Of The Drinks for the first time near its opening date in 2017. I always cherished the memories of my visit because of the occasion, good food and warm service by the staff. Now 2.5 years later, their attitude towards the visitors has deteriorated to the bottom. Not only did the staff member responsible for allocating seats canceled our reservation, but he also shouted and blamed us for being late! I do not control Mumbai traffic and when constantly called that we are running late due to traffic, he at least should have considered our request or the least should have been sorry that he had to cancel. But he was rude to the heights. Never ever would I visit the place again and would also stop all of my friends from visiting a place with horrible staff members.

I have been to social in Delhi many times. This one was near to my office and I thought of ordering my lunch from this place. The packing was superb no-spill nothing. Also, the food was tasty and nicely cooked. The sandwich was ok in taste but the burrito was damn tasty. If you want to have good food with a mug of beer then this is your place.  Cheers!
Only food was ok other than that everything was pathetic. Dj was playing song for himself only other than him nobody was dancing.  Don't go here even they will pay you. Social ruin my friend's bday celebration.
I went to Social Fun Republic and yes, you‚Äôre not allowed to drink without the age appropriate ID. One thing to be noted about this franchise is that the vibe and ambience is so so aesthetic, so cool, so vibrant. This particular branch had a floral, vintage, 80‚Äôs vibe. So pink I loved it lol.  Coming to the dishes, The Nachos were vegetarian and as great as nachos could be.  The next is the Sausage and Eggs Poutine, which is basically a dish with fries and heavy toppings. This one won. The third is the Fry-yay Platter, with vedges, fries, onion rings and tortilla chips. Grand. The fourth is Fish and Chips, which was good in quantity. However, the fish had a rancid, pukish taste to it. Ew, I know. Either something was wrong with it or it was just bad. Whatever it was, not recomended. The fifth was Penne in Curried Vegetables White. As good as any wonderful pasta.  Conclusion, Social was a great experience. Food, I still think I need to try out the vast menu to actually rate how good it is overall. But from the dishes I tried, an 8/10 I guess.
It's my birthday celebration. Everybody enjoyed a lot and thankyou social to give us a good platform to enjoy cherish a special occasion. Spent a good time.
The first thing that stands out for me wrt to Fun Republic Social is the ambience. It‚Äôs got that old school touch yet completely modern and chic. It‚Äôs always a happening place to be at with all the music and crowd pouring in. I went here with a couple of friends for quick meal and drinks and like always, it was worth every penny. BBQ Chicken Wings are my favourite and what better than pairing it with a pint of Budweiser Beer. If there‚Äôs something I would say needs improvement is the service that tends to get slow at times. Apart from that, everything seems to be top-notch at Socials.
I have ordered from this place.Food is good but too oily.
Good place to hangout and chill with friends. I had CadB and Cheese Shots, both were awesome and really tasty. Price was also quite reasonable. Service is prompt and fast.
Cafe safar usaully has young crowd and family crowd. Ambience and food quality is excellent. they are speacilist in mughail dishes. should visit cafe safar located in oshiwara, Andheriw west
Have ordered from this place. While the taste is decent, the dishes are usually too oily! This is a major setback. Else, decent.

The outlet is good for meets with friends. I have tried cappuccino from this outlet. The ambience is good with friendly staff. The breveges was fabulous. The service is good and quick. The quantity of food was good in reasonable prices. Highly recommend this place.
Few days before when i was near andheri west then i orderd from this place. They have nice cuisine. From there I orderd two items and they are:- Veg hakka noodles and chicken club house sandwitch. Talking about food :- so they were Cooked well Quantity of spice in both the items were good . They are amazing in taste. Quantity of food Was enough . For food quality and packaging i would rate it 5 out of 5. I highly recommend this restaurant.
Went Aromas cafe today.... It was toooo big n ambience was awesome... Too many selfie points there n much more... now come to food.. ordered ravioli pasta and pizZZAAA this was absolutely amazing.. dish.... up to the expectations.. and also hygienically made.... you'll loved it.. must recommended.....
Aromas cafe & Bistro is located at Oshiwara,Mumbai.. I visited here with my friends,we tried a masala chai,it was hot and amazing. Ambience looks great and prompt service is given.  Highly recommended this outlet...
House of party is a very good place to visit especially with your boyfriend or with the friends. We had came here for a date and since then we come to hop many a times.
This place is truely LITüî• we had a party here the dj was awesome we had a great time . The service is also fast
HOP, reading all the reviews we decided to go here on a Friday night.  As soon as you enter, you see a small restaurant and then is the dance floor.  The floor and the lights here are good.  However, the DJ is not up to the mark.  No latest songs being played and the tempo was really off.  Also, the service here is not upto the mark.  One fine bartender drank a sip from the shaker and gave exactly the same drink to a person there. This was absolutely gross.  About the beers, one pint here is about Rs 400 which is absolutely not worth it according to the place.  The food service is also slow and the taste was very average.  There was no filter on the crowd that was being let in. Management needs to work on a lot many things in order to make the place up to the mark.  Never visiting here again.
the staff here is friendly as well as the management . the place is astonishing and deserves some insta worthy pictures . the food here also has a unique flavour and an amazing approch thumbs up this place üëçüèª
Their menu is different and amazing. Their menu is just fantastic and so from that I had tried out variety of items and they were great. The music over hop was great and also the staffs were friendly and great to serve.
Been to R adda last week and I was excited to visit this place as it is known for its reputation as best party place in Mumbai.  ¬†  This place has one of the best ambience and I would personally recommend in terms of awesome decor and loud music. They need some  improvement in terms of service as every order we placed used to come by 30 minutes on an average and also it was disappointing us  as it was a Monday night. We had Prawns Charmoula and Veg Nachos. The taste was good and the portion was value for money.  ¬†  We ordered cocktails, Kiwi Slush and Melon Sour. Both were nicely presented and tasted really awesome. Since I am a cocktail fan I  expected slightly more but it was fine.  ¬†  The mains we ordered was Daal khichdi and I really loved the taste and ended with Tiramisu. Overall place is really good apart from on  time service. Rest all awesome.
Located on 6th floor of Ramee Guestline hotel in Juhu. This can be easily said as one of the most happening places in this area.  Ambience gives you hint that how this place will be once it's crowded. Interiors done in style and the vibrant feel is worth enjoying. Bar setup is so classy and was really busy throughout our visit.  Service was little slow initially but later on it was fine.  Food menu suits the theme of the lounge. Quick food dishes satisfying the hunger along with good drinks. Portion size was just perfect I felt. Bar has few of the classical cocktails which you can enjoy along with the food.  LIIT (Cocktail) ‚Äì A classic at its best, made with 5 white spirits like vodka, gin, white rum, triple sec and tequila poured on top of coke. Loved it. (5/5)  COSMOPOLITIAN (Cocktail)- Perfect mix of vodka and cranberry juice, can say a real comfort drink. (4.5/5)  MARGARITA (Cocktail)- Ordered this as we know nothing can go wrong with this drink and was so correct. (5/5)  BUTTER GARLIC PRAWNS (Appetizers)- Thick king prawns tossed in butter and garlic along with some mix peppers and well-seasoned with salt and white pepper. It was garnished well with spring onions. A wow dish, must try. One of my favourites. (5/5)  FISH TIKKA (Appetizers) ‚Äì Fish chunks marinated in tikka margination and then cooked perfectly in tandoor. It was served with onion slices and green chutney. Fish was cooked to the perfection and margination had good smoky taste. (4.5/5)  R ADDA STYLE CHILLI CHICKEN (Appetizers)- Chicken chunks batter fried and then tossed in garlic and light soy along with mix peppers, green chillies and lots of spring onions. A perfect dish to order along with your drinks. (5/5)  LAAL MASS WITH LACCHA PARATHA (Mains)- A authentic and famous Rajasthani mutton preparation served along with laccha paratha, onion rings and a lemon wedge. Mutton was cooked so well, gravy had fantastic texture and colour too. (5/5)  FISH CURRY TICE (Mains) ‚Äì Best main courses are always comfort zone dishes/Indian cuisine dishes. This was a fish curry made in goan style with good tempering of curry leaves and mustard seeds which was served along with a steam rice. (4.5/5)  TIRAMISU (Dessert)- A authentic Italian dessert served in a martini glass. I can say I had good tiramisu after many days for sure. Loved it. (5/5)
A place to hangout with the best of music and food! Situated on the rooftop of Ramee Guestline Hotel, Juhu. This is a place for people who are very specific about the superior quality of food and service. A beautiful and luxurious ambiance surely makes your visit memorable. Every dish in their menu is of finest taste and is served to diners after a 24*7 fine work that Chefs put in.
Party place with amazing food & crazy cocktail.  Well designed place, with good music. It's a great place to chill with friends  on our visit , we tried, whisky sour.. amazing. Penne Alfredo.. classic n the way it should , creamy rich. Waffles, crispy from outside and perfect moist inside.  overall a great place to party. Great place to go to

Amritsari aloo. Kulcha which is served with chole and raita. Cheese chilli toast and Desi style egg bhurji which tastes just too good not too bland or more spicy..

This is a club where you can have lots of fun with your friends. This place is very nice. Prices are little high for some of the dishes but worth to try it.  Food: 5/5 Talking about food quality and taste this place is perfect. We tried their few of the dishes. 1) Drinks: Sex on The Beach Mocktail, Jal Jira Mocktail, Chatpata Cocktail and Ghas Poos Cocktail this all are with unique name with unique taste and looks very nice. 2) Starters and Main course: Fish Fry, Chiken Tikka, Yeda Fire Wings, Chiken Popcorn, Chiken Kheema Pizza, BBQ Pizza, Pinnoe Chiken Pasta, Chiken Biryani, etc. All the dishes are served with very nice plating looking amazing. All of the dishes is of good quality and tasted very nice. 4) Desserts: Chocolate Hazelnut Fondent and Pan Falooda both desserts are really awesome and worth to have it.  Ambience:5/5 The ambience is very nice and eye catchy.  Service:5/5 Staff is very polite and nice. Plating is just fabulous. Place is hygienic. Service is very good.  Recommendation: All of the dishes were very good in taste but mine favorite dishes and must try dishes are Pizza, Yeda Fire Wings and Pan Falood. Falooda was expensive but it is very nice and worth to have it at that price.
One of the best dance atmosphere I have see in any club is Yeda Republic. This Place is very pocket friendly with polite staff and good service which makes it a ideal place for the party animals. This place has got a fine interiors and a large space which makes it comfortable to chill out. The food served here is delicious .
Worst Staffs, They will charge you entry ticket of 2000rs. So now if u order a bucket of Budweiser beer they will charge you 1350rs for 4 beers. While in there menu card its clearly written 300rs for single pint of beer. If you ask the bartender about it. He will say 400rs ka ek Budweiser aata hai lena hai toh lo warna jane do. They simply loot people there. Will not at all recommend this place to anyone.
In the words of one of their crew, ‚ÄúSir, 400 log aate hai.. sabko serve nahi kar sakte‚Äù. This was when the number of staff was more than the number of guests. Professionalism at its best. People were smoking next to the bar when smoking was supposedly restricted to the smoking area only.
The place has a different atmosphere unlike other clubs. I enjoyed the music along with their special cocktails For starters We had jalapeno cheese bites, Tandoori lollypop Yeda fire wings Chicken was cooked well and was tasty. For cocktails we tried yheir blue frog, jal jeera mojito,sangria,meetha nimboo All drinks were chilled with unique taste For maincourse we had chicken tikka biryani, which was also cooked to perfectionüëçüèª Overall experience was too goodüî•
I was at Tanatan yesterday for dinner. This restaurant has bells hanging all over, big and small, nice seating arrangements and the best part is the Live music.  Coming to the drinks and food, we tried a lot of varities, but few of my recommendation are üëåSharabi kawa - Beautiful smoke and cinnamon drink üëåPan Ki Shaan - Fantasic drink with pan taste üëåMushroom gassi with neer dosa üëå Khow souy samosa üëå Phirni  An additional star for the live band
Tanatan, a restaurant located in the prime location of Juhu, is by far one of the classiest places in Mumbai. The dark and mystic interior's, combined with great food and soothing live music make it a great place to enjoy mouthwatering food with friends and family. I ordered a Juhu Kala Khatta, Pondi to Mumbai, Dilli ki Galliyon Se and Raunake Seekh. By far one of the greatest dishes I've ever had, Raunake Seekh, which had Mutton Seekh dipped in Cheese, made my day. It was perfect in every way. Juhu Kala Khatta was not bad either, it had a great blend of Ice, Kala Khatta Juice and Sugar. Even after so many great dishes to enjoy the icing on the cake was the live music. It was so soothing and calming and made me feel great. All in all, it is one of the best places to go out with your family and friends. I encourage everybody to give this place a try.
One of the best place to visit ,if you are in worli i.e BOMBAY STREET CO. The ambience is decent and soothing.  üç∑MOCKTAILSüç∑ ‚Ä¢Watermelon mojito -Its very good and it opens up your mind .üç∑üç∑üç∑üç∑ ‚Ä¢Peach Ice Tea-One of the best drink to try ,for those who want decent peach taste ,its a unique drink .üç∑üç∑üç∑üç∑ üç°STARTERSüç° ‚Ä¢Kung pao cottage cheese-One of the best starter to go with. Its a must try starter.üç°üç°üç°üç°üç° ‚Ä¢Younger poppers-This is another must try dish üç°üç°üç°üç°üç° üç±APPETIZERSüç± ‚Ä¢Gini dosa- A must try dish.Its really amazing as it is filled with gratted paneer .üç±üç±üç±üç±üç± ‚Ä¢Thainese biryani-A MUST TRY DISH.Its a combination of indian and thai taste,With a green gravy is simply amazing .Plz do try and do visit.üç±üç±üç±üç±üç±
I visited this place last week for the first time and I was in awe! The ambience is amazing! There's a total Indian vibe in this place. The bar is superb! Their cocktails are just as amazing and unique as their names. I had the fiery jugaad. The drink is as good as the way the bartender makes it. I started my meal with some kozhi ghee roast. It's a chicken starter that has a lot of ghee in it. It's simply delicious. I found this unique dish for mains, sunny side appam with chicken sukkha. There's an appam topped with a half fried egg and served with delicious chicken. This is one tasty combination. For desert, I had the firni which was nice too.
Good food, great ambience and amazing live music üé∂ü§§üòç This place is absolute wonder, Just won my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è

So i went here for my friend's bdayy and exprience was fairly good... Staffs are friendly and coop√©rative.. View is amazing and food is delicious We had four cheese pizza.. It was perfect blend of 4 cheese and sauce 5/5‚≠ê Next we had was white sauce pasta 5/5‚≠ê And lastly chocolate truffle for d√©sert 4/5‚≠ê
The place is just good for ambience and a few drinks, if you‚Äôre heavy on cash.  The food sucks. Very unprofessional staff.  DO NOT INVEST IN DESSERTS. Chocolate truffle cake is topped off with a layer of overly sweet condensed milk.
This place has best view and ambiance. I wish the staff was a little more attentive and the menu is not so great
Food was really amazing üòâ ambience issss jusssttt sooooo beautiful ü•∞ can say best place to get best clicks worth visiting üòâüòâüòâwe will visit it too soon
Testy food, fentatstic music, lovely ambiance and completely fresh - one of the best place to chill with your friends. As usual I had ordered beer and pizza and the service was good.
Great place to chill and have a drink. They have great music over the weekend. The staff is polite and attentive. The ambience is amazing. The food was yummy and definitely worth a visit
Slow service. From ordering food, refills of drinks and water to requesting for bill. Might have spent an extra hour waiting. However, the ambience looks good.
Not worth visiting, food was ok many other restaurants nearby are far better. please look out for some other place for better food & ambience..Hope owner take care after renovation.
It was a little empty but the food was very delicious. Also, the quantity was pretty fine. The ambiance is very pretty plus, the restaurant is very spacious! Tippling street has really good crowd and is located in one of the most visited areas in Juhu
The music was great. The staff was friendly with courteous services. The food was tasty and appropriate however could have been presented in a better manner. The food was expensive though.
It's a great place to be enjoying your night with friends because the ambience is chirpy and too great to be ordinary. The drinks here are a big up but the food quantity which the serve given the price they charge, it's not quite satisfactory. Nonetheless, all in all, a great place to spend your weekend. D is the best here, i.e. DANCE AND DRINKS Ambience: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Food: ‚≠ê‚≠ê Value for money:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Service: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
My entire experience here was not very pleasant. To keep it short and simple, the food was great and I'd recommend the fish and chips and cheese stuffed chicken and this rating is solely for the food. My drink was served with a fly and when we intimated the server, they replaced my drink(which they didn't seem very happy about) with another drink that tasted like only sugar and water and not worth drinking at all. We decided to leave and our bill had major errors in the pricing of the items which they first accepted and apologized for and later to our unpleasant surprise, started arguing to state that the menu had inadvertently wrong pricing written. Clearly cooking up excuses which was extremely unpleasant and turning off üôã

Everything was terrible, soup was cold, paneer Tikka was just tasteless and boiled paneer, management and waiters were rude, bread was stale and so hard that I might have broken a tooth or 2 trying to chew it. We started with the soup and requested for a breads they came after so long and then moving on to the paneer it was so terrible, and the vegetables for main course as well. No balance in taste, no support from staff, they say that's how it should taste but kid you not you'll feel your home cook could cook so much better than the food we had there with our family. Waste of a Sunday evening meal, unfriendly staff, overall terrible experience. Would suggest not to go and try some other mind blowing restaurants in and around the vicinity instead.

We ordered the vegetarian pizza which was a little bland and had to spice it up with √≥rgano chilli flakes and tobasco Later we ordered Strawberry milkshake which was average and tasted like it‚Äôs home made. The look of it was not appealing. For dessert we ordered chocolate hazelnut fondue which was really delicious and mouth watering. It tasted healthy and had a good presentation also. Before the meal we were served with everyone‚Äôs favourite - complimentary chaat sev puri. The staff was friendly and polite.
Rice quality is not so gud when it is said to be a biryani the grains are normal ones. The preparation is very much dry however the chicken is gud.
First time I tried butter chicken from this place ordered combo of butter chicken with 2 tandoori roti the butter chicken was very tasty 2 people can eat in this quality there are many chicken pieces in it Delivery- 8/10 Food-10/10 Quantity-9/10
Sardar Ji - Juhu Best place to visit for North Indian Food. Also they have delivery outlet services. A hygienic place to visit and Budget friendly. Even the staffs were very friendly
Try Aloo paratha, Even though it's a common dish but here the taste is too good and it comes with raita and pickle. Also can try the dish named Lahori Tikka, it was too amazing. The quantity was good.

The place is simply amazing. Must visit this place to have the best pizzas in mumbai. The pizzas are simply amazing and its taste will force you to come again.üòÖ                                             ‚Ä¢Butter chicken- This pizza is next level,it gives amazing taste with cheese burst. It has butter chicken,onion and coriander with tandoori sauce.üçïüçïüçïüçïüçï(rating style) ‚Ä¢Keema do pyaza- This is another pizza which is always up to the mark. It has spicy chicken keema and onion .Its simply amazing . üçóüçóüçóüçóüçó Do visit this placeüôèüôè
The staff is extremely rude. They shout at you, ignore you and what not. I swear theyre taking advantage of their taste but soon some other outlet will overtake Joey's. They're getting too overconfident. The manager seems to be too busy to enjoy the money he's earning but he must look at his staff and teach them some manners.

All the hype this place has created , i really wanted to try the burgers here .. and i am so impressed.. the burgers were so amazing .. loved the soft bun,juicy chicken flavorful sauces.. the jalepeno poppers were quite cheesy .. loved them too.. both the burgers that we tried crunchy fried chicken & the stuffed herb cheese were rocking.. I loved the herb one more.. All n all an amazing experience
Food here is way above what we expected, the new menu is to die for. And what makes our experience even better, is the hospitality and courteous staff here. Loved our visit here!

1441 pizzeria is one of the famous outlet for pizzas and they also serves pastas, drinks, etc. I had visited it's Malad West outlet which has amazing interior from inside and the seating arrangement was good too. And the pizzas they serves has a thin crust and they give the option to make pizza by their own. Really I had a amazing Tim here with my friends I loved this outlet must do visit here.
This place is located at malad west..10 mins drive from malad railway station........ The place is a heaven for pizza lovers.. I really enjoyed visiting here... They have amazing pizzas and pastas.... The ambience is also nice... The services were also good and the taste of pizzas were just awesome.. I tried some pizza and lemonade here..and they were just mouth watering... üëâhere's what I tried...  üí•Litchi lemonade...  üí•bbq chicken wings  üí•jalapeno poppers  üí•BBQ chicken pizza..  THIS PLACE IS WORTH VISITING...
The most uncivilised restaurant i have ever seen. I could not even place an order after waiting for more than 45 minutes. Even after checking with wait staff 4 times, they said give me 10 minutes, and never came back to take the order. It‚Äôs not worth visiting even for free.
Amazing service by Sneden, We're more than satisfied with the food. All fresh with great flavours. Love the tiramisu hereüëåWill definitely visit again!
Good taste for satisfying taste buds and very friendly staff @sneden. And good service

Evas pizza located in Malad west is one of the best place to be with friends . The ambience over here is amazing , when you have 3 -4 friends then you can chill out on bean bag. Veg deluxe pizza and popeyes was amazing and also my favourite pizza was chicken pizza.
One of the best pizzas I‚Äôve ever had.  Hands down the amazing place to head to with a group of friends. If you‚Äôve Gold it‚Äôs a plus point.  Fairly priced.  Overall a good experience

"The place is located in the interiors of ram bagh lane near chincholi fatak.Veg Deluxe pizza & popeyes pizza delicious. Topping was heavy. Place is good to visit with friends n chillax.Ambience is amazing. Their meal pack is worth a try. I specially recommend ""Mom's delight"" (paneer tikka one). And yes when you are 3-4 friends you can chill out on bean bags.If you are a die hard fan of cheesy pizza with extra toppings, Eva's Pizza is the best place to be. The chicken Tikka was also yummy. All time best place for me to have üçï"
Went first time on my anniversary. Was disappointed. Food was not good, DJ was Ok.
Excellent eating experience... from walking in the door and being greeted by employee, seated and food order taken, was maybe 5 minutes. Meal was served hot and excellent taste. Server was very friendly and helpful.I really appreciate your effortsüòáüòç. GOOD LUCKüíØüòá
I have visited here long time back and i was thinking to write review about this place from long time.¬† Interiors is excellent and loved the them of restaurant.¬† Interiors is well design according to name of restaurant.¬† Food was good, music was excellent, service was quite slow which can better.¬† Over all worth of money to visit with friends.
Food is good but service is a bit slow. Well, live dj is amazing with great ambiance.

Poor quality of ingredients
We visited this place for dinner yesterday. The order the Crostini chicken which is cheese garlic bread with mince Chicken. It was a nice way to start the meal. We ordered the mad Max burger which was big. It can easily fill two people. The next thing we ordered was the Tenderloine Steak which was served with bacon, vegetables and mashed potatoes. Over the food was very good and enjoyable.
We went to this place after reading on zomato - wanted to try this place . The ambience was pretty positive and amazing . Loved the place  - very lively and vibrant .   We started off with pork hot dog and barbecue chicken wings with ranch . Both the dishes where amazing . Followed it up with pork chops - absolutely well cooked . Meat was tender and the sauce was perfect . Served with veggies and mashed potatoes.   Followed it up with peri peri prawns with herbed rice . The sauce was cremy and good . Loved it to the core . Wanted to try more dishes but we where stuffed .   Finally ended up with a perfect desert - ice cream with whipped creme and some toppings. A must try place in my views .
Good food, Affordable rates, Good quantity and a big menu to choose from. Nice place to chill. Polite staff. Worth a visit!

Great place to hangout with friends. This place has superb music. Bit small dance floor but thats completely fine. Food quality is just awesome. I ordered Pasta - nice sauce consistency, pasta to veggie ratio was maintained  Fried chicken - It was wow, perfect crip on every bite. Chicken was clean from inside and was completely cooked.  Hot Guava Mocktail - Dont go with the name, the hot mentioned is for the spiciness of the Tabasco sauce. Tastes delicious.  Staff were humble and polite, liked the way they serve Water in the glass bottle. Overall had a great experience.
Love the place n location, just add tasyy food options, basic like green chutney shud b USP to starters
The best place I have visited ever  the bar men Anand was best at the service n the music was the best DJ Rahul is the master at the play list best songs at the sinck loved the place n the ambience very much
Had been to Carter Road social and was impressed with the services specially by Sandeep as well as Anwar. They went all their way to present us with the best night. Of our lives. It was a pleasure coming. Here. Will be back soon for more food and fun
Love the forest vibe here. The green theme really speaks to me. And those neon signs just add the perfect  amount of quirk.  We all love social. Admit it.
Carter Road Social Is One Of The Many Social Outlets In Mumbai. Their Ambiance Always Sets A Lively Vibe. Over Here Everything Is Perfect, The Food, The Music Playlist, The Staff, The Sea Facing View. Now Coming To The Food, Here‚Äôs What All I Tried -  (1) Paneer Chilli - This Is Definitely A Must Try For All Vegetarians. A Perfect Chinese Starters Dish That Will Leave You Wanting For More. Price - Rs. 240 (2) Jalape√±o Mac And Cheese With Parmesan Crust - A Traditional Mac And Cheese Spiked With Jalape√±o And Topped With A Fresh Crust Of Herbs, Cheese & Crumbs.  Price - Rs. 350 (3) Fri-Yay Platter - This Dish Serves Potato Wedges, Cajun Fries, Onion Rings And Tapioca Chips With 3 Different Dips - Salsa, Cheese And Mayo. A Dish Hard To Resist And Difficult To Share. Price - Rs. 270

Carter's aaye and socials ki vibe ko mehsoos nahi kiya toh kya hi kiya. Beautiful and serene place. A different vibe altogether at this social. A pint of beer along with some starters will make your day. Waiting time is too long which is a pain and also food quality can improve.
The best place to sip in a drink and have a quality time with some parallel discussion that is work or not so work-related. Best ambiance with amazing people to serve and super friendly with smiling faces and the food taste amazing.¬† All and out a good place to get together.
Cocktails were awesome  vibrant feeling good atmosphere u can enjoy with ur family . Good food must try Mohammad Ali road biryani ..beautiful stranger cocktail ..and diavolo ..
I liked the ambience and the entire range of curated menu which helps in tasting different styles of food and drinks.  The staff their is humble and helps you in making correct choice according to your likes. I liked their food and drinks a lot

So we were celebrating our anniversary with few of our friends. It was great experience even had. We ordered few dishes every thing was tremendous delicious etc. According to my personal experience I liked extra hot America pizza and butter garlic prawns with rosemary bread, pizza was perfectly backed and made and suggested by chef Aniket. Chef was very good with us eventually many thanks to service team special Yogesh and Sid who suggested to Choose many other dishes. Finally it was great experience with you guys Bandar Project by Pizza Express and once again thank for our beautiful evening.
I visited this place with a friend of mine, looking for good italian food. And our expectations were thoroughly satisfied. The pizza crust was perfectly baked, the sauces were perfect, also the staff was generous and helpful enough to make us choose in their menu. All over it was a good visit and would recommend people to do visit it once.

Good service by Anthony , kalpesh , excellent food served , Peri Peri chicken was outstanding with food white decor.
Kalpesh is an amazing person ! I mean smoke house deli is being my favourite for the last 5 years and always a big welcome and a big smile to give the best experience!! Love this place and to be honest food is amazing and kalpesh just add and extra gesture to it !
We came here for lunch a friend's birthday celebration. It was absolutely amazing. The food, the service, the experience, everything was just amazing. Kalpesh was especially helpful and made sure we had a great time. The sangria scene is beautiful. Come here for lunch or dinner, you are certain to have a great time.
Their 2 hour sangria deal is as always the most fun. Kalp esh is absolutely the guy you need to meet here. The food is super tasty and no matter when you come it‚Äôs going to be a great time :)
The cashier was tooo rude.

Renowned for its waffles, we decided to pay this outlet a visit. It has a fairly extensive menu including all day breakfast, pastas along with beverages and waffles available at regular Di Bella eateries. The ambience is good and the place is very spacious.  Nutella Oreo Crunch Waffle This featured as a gourmet waffle and three of us decided to share it. The positives are the portion of the waffles and toppings was generous. However, the service was very slow. We were brought a different waffle accidentally which also had a hair in it. Thankfully it was taken away. Also, the whipped cream had a peculiar aftertaste and didn't seem fresh.  Food: 4/5 Service: 2.5/5 Ambience: 4.5/5 Value for money: 3.5/5  Final verdict: Waffles are Di Bella are usually worth a try. I guess they had a bad day this time.
If you are coffee lover and this place is Good to visit. They offer great variety and location is also nice Amazing milk shakes with fancy names and great snacks. Great coffee shop with excellent service.¬† Great stuff and would love to visit again. This above mentioned place is very good for waffles. They have many varieties of waffles. And is good
The WORST HOT CHOCOLATE IN THE HISTORY OF HOT CHOCOLATES. PLEASE DON'T SERVE your customers utter üí©, soooooo disappointed!! I should've just drank bournvita man. #supersadcustomer
Love the place .
Was visiting Mumbai when I stumbled upon this place right next to my hotel. I'm not much of a salad person, but I have to say I was in for a pleasant surprise with the salads they offer. They were unique, tasty and not too much lettuce. The chicken and bacon sandwich was recommended by the restaurant and it was mind blowing
Love it
Nice place and food. Feeling of having out at the same time consuming healthy food. Must go place when in bandra

Awesome taste of guru Kripa hotel basically it is famous for its Samosa and chole and really it is best for samosa‚Äôs in all over Mumbai and it‚Äôs lassi is also theek and very tasty üòãüòã at least once in life come and try their food guys....
Many people recommended this place to us for some good range of north indian food. We tried their signature dishes samose chole, lassi, chole bhature plate, the place is very hygenic, food will not disappoint you, it actually taste really good. The crowd and waiting lines will prove you that. The services are pretty quick. You can satisfy your tummy with some really good food in very less amount of money, totally worth it.
A great place to visit and eco friendly
Love their famous chole samosa üòçüòç

Hardeep Punjab has one of its two outlets in Sion, Mumbai. It is a fine dining place w pleasant ambience & comfortable seating arrangements. They serve north indian, chinese & seafood. . . We tried, ‚Ä¢ main course - mutton dhaba style w cheese garlic naan & burnt garlic fried rice ‚Ä¢ starters - paneer koliwada & chicken chaska maska ‚Ä¢ beverages - mango lassi & cranberry mojito ‚Ä¢ dessert - sizzling brownie & ice cream . . The dhaba styled dhaba styled curry in delicious soft meat served in a cooker is highly recommended. Our visit here is not complete without the chaska maska which has a creamy finish to every morsel. Both the beverages were equally good, the lassi is quite heavy though. Ended our meal w the gooey sizzling brownie. . . The staff is courteous & the service is prompt. Also, they have v good hygiene maintained. The avg cost for two people would be around ‚Çπ1200 approx. . . Taste the unique flavour of Punjab @hardeeppunjab

A buzzing place in Sion. Amazing place to chill with friends located very close to sies college.Having an ambience with historical d√©cor embedded with wooden furniture made visit to colonial palate worthwhile.Talking about food, if you are looking for beautiful presentations and food with mind blowing combinations of flavors and spices then this is your spot. They managed to try some awesome dishes such as pasta, nachos, paneer barbeque pizza and irish coffee. The service was prompt.Service which was undoubtedly top notch and has high probability to make you feel special. Also, their knowledge on every dish is quite admirable. Overall, We loved this place and would highly recommend to go to with your loved ones for a memorable evening.Average Cost ‚Çπ 350 For Two (Approx.) They also provide live sport screening .
Cafe Ista Location: It's situated near sion station.  Staff and Ambience: The staff is very friendly and well responsive. A great cafe if you wanna chill with friends or have a work conversation with your colleaguesor even for your date! Staff and Ambience: 5/5  Beverages: Irish Latte; 4/5 Cappuccino: 5/5 Crispy Potato Wedges: 5/5 Mumbai Grilled Sandwich: 5/5
For the super heavy pricing that you are charging, the taste of the food is just unacceptable. We we're lucky that the taste was not great and so the portion size that was sent in the parcel was okay. But at the cost that you are charging, I am ashamed to say the quantity is super less. Humus and pita bread was super disappointing. One small baby box of sauce is what was provided in the name of humus and pita bread was small 4 pieces. Taste of risotto n the pasta was very very okay. Again not the taste u expect when u pay such a high price ! Spicy garlic bread was equally disappointing as it was almost ladi-pav where a little sauce, cheese and lots of chilli flakes were put on !
Really amazing place to hangout with your friends. The place is located near SIES College near sion station. It serves some really mouth watering food like thousand Island fries and also some common but wonderful dishes like cheese garlic bread. The service is also really nice.
Cafe Istaa is very close to Sion circle. After watching a movie me and my friends crashed at this place to satisfy our hunger. Place is nice and cozy, good ambience.

It's a small place located in Sion just 2 mins walk from Sion station. There are two sections for seating AC and Non-AC. The tables are quite small to eat comfortably. Service was quick even though it was crowded. There's also a waiting area outside. It is famous for its seafood items and their Fish thali.  What we ordered: ‚Ä¢Surmayi Fish Thali- It includes one curry, sabzi, fried fish or inside the curry(which we ordered), rice bhakri/Chapati/Roti/Vade, solkadi and Rice. Rate 5/5  ‚Ä¢Sukha Chicken- It was prepared in  Mangalorean style with lots of shredded coconuts. The quantity was good for 2 people. We ordered a bhakri to go along with it as they were short of kombdi Vades (tastes amazing with it).Rate 4/5  ‚Ä¢Sukha Shimple- Again it was prepared in Mangalorean style with lots of shredded coconuts. Quantity is sufficient for two people. Rate 4/5  ‚Ä¢Bombil Fry- We ordered one plate of it.Super crispy and cleaned properly. MUST TRY!! Rate 5/5  ‚Ä¢Solkadi-We ordered it separately as it's an excellent appetizer, but was a disappointment. It could have been better. Some flavours were lacking .Rate 0/5  ***They don‚Äôt serve any desserts :(
There is a small hotel near Sion Station. This is a great place to get fish food. Its non AC is basic with only 10 tables. They have AC - it was very crowded and it was. Also waiting. Chicken lollipop with shrubby, pomfret, suramai and shrimp fry for rava starter. I took away a star because I thought there might be more dishes on the plate
"Heard about this restaurant much on social media pages for a long time‚Ä¶Though never managed it to be here personally. One fine day when I had to plan my dinner out as parents were not at home. That was the moment I gave a visit to this place all alone. A 2 mins walk from Sion station and there you are at Sion Lunch Home. Initial impressions were surprising after seeing it heavily crowded during week days. One good reason why this place is so prominent for its seafood delicacies. It has two sections for seating AC & NON ‚Äì AC. As I was craving for Fish badly didn‚Äôt bothered where I‚Äôll get to sit. After a mins of waiting got my table. Thankfully no one else sat opposite to me. So it was time to have hands on their Fish Thali. I went for the Pomfret Thali which was tawa fried. There are other options too‚Ä¶Masala/fry, Chilly Indian, Puli Munchi‚Ä¶.  Food:  1>	Pomfret Thali (tawa fried) ‚Äì For a moment I didn‚Äôt even felt to start munching as it looked so tempting only just by seeing it. Though couldn‚Äôt wait any longer and started off by squeezing the lemon over the pomfret. My My it was a heavenly feeling experiencing the taste of pomfret. Perfectly cooked and with the right amount of spices made it more delectable. It was served with Bhakri, Sol Kadhi, Rassa, Veg gravy and rice. A total value for money.  Ambience ‚Äì As mentioned above in the summary it is suitable for family gatherings, special occasions and if you are alone like I was step ahead it will leave your soul satisfied. Seating is comfortable and the interiors are kept plain and simple.  Service ‚Äì Staff was quick and fast with the service.  Food ‚Äì 5/5  Ambience ‚Äì 3/5  Service ‚Äì 5/5  Bon Appetite seafood lovers‚Ä¶.."

The ambiance is quite pleasing to eyes, also one of the famous restaurant in Sion. The staffs here are very friendly. My fav dish from here is Paneer Tikka Masala, try with Butter naan. Just wow. Must visit
I like their hospitality and service is 5 star hotel standard. food is awesome. like it overall.
Went personally to order a takeaway after watching a movie at PVR. Ordered¬† Paneer Lababdar and garlic naan. The Paneer Lababdar was spoilt!! Spent over Rs. 500 to get a spoilt paneer dish. Extremely disappointing. They probably wanted to get rid of their spoilt dish on a takeaway order given there is little chance I would end up complaining or returning the dish. Utter lack of professionalism.

This was REALLY satisfying and worth the price. LOVED IT
Box 8 One of the Outlet of Box8 in Wadala I had Ordered MayoTikki Wrap Amritsari Chole Choco Lava Cake The delivery of food items where on time and the food was warm too when it was delivered to me ...

Ordered from box 8, 2 dhaba style chicken box & a chciken tikka wrap. Both the boxes were amazing and did had great amazing quantity to fill one man's tummy from a single box ! Talking about the chicken tikka wrap, we also found it delicious and yummilious. Now talking about the delivery, the food was delivered to us within 35mins of time as they promised. And served us hot.
Box 8 [WADALA] Totally amazing experience here The quality of the food was just too good I would recommend:  Mushroom masala meal [All-in-1 meal, Paratha+Rice(Half), dal makhni , Gulab jamun]  Shahi paneer biryani  Desert[pack of 4] [Gulab Jamun , Rich chocolate Brownie , choco lava cake , choco lava cake ]  Just once try tue above items 4.8/5 ;))

Had to wait for almost 2 hrs to get our order delivered. They have their own valet delivery.Tried their contact numbers for over 30 mins. Could not get through. Had to make my guests wait for the food. Totally embarrassing. The only saviour was that once it arrived, the food was good. That‚Äôs why the 3 stars. For delivery I would give them a minus 1.
Yesterday order Paneer tika masala, naan and fried rice.. All are tasty and fresh.. Quantity was also better.
Looking for indo-italian cuisine,, this is the best place to bump in ! They serve variety of baked pizzas with alot of melting cheese on it. You will also enjoy their Indian cuisine. A quite good ambience with stable lighting. They need to improve their service a bit. Ordered a dish and it arrived 30 mins later. Which is a downside. I would say visit them on weekdays for better service. Talking about food, it was good enough not upto the mark. They need some improvements.
Pot de Fusion is my favorite multi cuisine restaurant in Goregaon. The restaurant is located at film city road and I have been visiting this restaurant since years now. The taste is consistent and quality is sublime. Lamb Messy burger and Murgh rahra are my all time favorite dishes. The place is total value for money.
It was a great experience. Good food amazing and friendly service special mention to Dilip. Must visit. Get your social feel worth for your price.

Got wonderful service from Neharika..
Alisha is a sweetheart. She has always been very friendly and courteous. Her suggestions are great and she is extremely professional. Thank you for a wonderful experience Alisha :)
It was an amazing experience in here. The place had a good ambience and the space was comfortable too with great service.  The food was pretty good from preparation to presentation and the ambience was great with good music.  Would love to come back here with my friends and family
So our bartender Jay made sure we had a wonderful time once we got here on Saturday evening. With good music banging in the background and live screening of football matches, it's a very laidback, chilled out place to kick it in with your boys. Definitely must visit to watch football matches with your friends over a drink, or just to catch up with your friends in general. Lovely ambience with a friendly staff, highly recommendedüç∫
Well, to start with, we got here at 8pm on Saturday night not knowing how the place would be but we were pleasantly surprised when we walked in. With a nice in-house dj banging out house music and football matches in the background, the place had a nice ambience with a very friendly staff. A must visit place to start off your weekend, highly recommended. Cheersü•Çü•Çü•Ç

On Friday we went for team party, overall experience was average. Food was good and staff is also nice, but if you planning for drinks then you have to be careful. The beverage rate was too high compare to alcohol. The thupsup of 500ml was charged 200 rs a very surprising rate..
A great place to dine & drink Bombay 63. Right from the door man to service staff all excellent. Staff made you feel at home. Food served was tasty and superb presentation. Section in charge Mr.Tirtharaj very informative & service rendered was great.Most important he always had a smile.An asset to the organisation. Music was just the right kind. Cashiers well trained. Manager Mr.Ashley came and checked how was everything a very good touch. Bombay 63 keep up the great service you are rendering to your clients.

Farzi Cafe is a complete fine dine restaurant in downtown Mumbai. It has a proper classy ambiance .It serves dishes in a extra fancy style.  The first picture is of their dessert ' Chocolate Dirt Pile ' it was completely chocolatey and full of dry fruits it also had brownie crumbs in it and they also were pretty soft and tasty.  The second picture is of their dessert ' Ras Malai Tres Leches ' . The rasmalai was the one that tasted the best out of this two desserts.The presentation and sweetness everything about it was perfect. It was stuffed with carrot cream in between and was garnished on top with a rose petal net and all of this was properly presented with flavoured milk.  So, overall Farzi cafe stayed up to the hype that it has in the market and pleased us with its polite and fast serving staff.
We ordered beer & Farzi Tina cocktail, loved the cocktail. We also ordered Chicken Wings, Papdi Chaat Nachos, Tempura Fried Prawns, Chicken Wings (3ways), Tandoori Mutton Chops. Everything was well made, beautifully plated & tasty. Though the sour cream with the Nachos was Watery & tasted more like yoghurt. The waiter suggested we try the The Chocolate Dirt Pile & it was really nice. Every morsel added something different which made it a very enjoyable experience. The service was excellent, Gufran & Shaheen were really sweet & service was quick & attentive. Will definitely recommend & visit again.
Special thanks for the Amazing hospitality by Shashank lal and Nishiket ( Manager ), Best place for Family dinner. food is good, music is awesome..loved the Complimentary shots , candy floss etc...you just made it one of the most memorable experiences. Zorawar kalra wins hearts when it comes to dining experiences. Must visit places once in a lifetime. I am very grateful to be your guest. Thank you , Thank you, Thank you üíïüíï

Recently I Ordered From This Place Called Spukies The Veg Sigree which Is In Goregoan East My Friends Had Suggested Alot of times to order It From Here But Dint Listen Now Finally Planned To Order From Here And Belive Me Or Not Its a Best Veg Restaurant I Ever Ordered From The Way It was Prepared The Way It was Delivered The Taste of it was really very good We Called For Ghotala Rice , Harabhara Kebab With Cheesy Twist,Zingat Soya Chilly DryIn Main Course I Cslled For mushroom Schezwan Fried Rice , HongKong Fried Rice And In Gravy gobi Manchurian gravy And Baby Corn Paneer Chilli Gravy..The Bill Was also not a big amout it was a cheap and Affordable.....

It was an amazing experience!! The food was AMAZING and I totally recommend it! Our table in charge, Tejas, and his assistant/colleague were very polite and courteous! Greatly impressed by their service! They also surprised us with a cake as we were celebrating my parents' wedding anniversary! The ambience is good, cozy and well air conditioned. We walked out very happy. A 10/10 experience.
The manager who took our order was very nice and helpfulü§óüëç
Lovely place,amazing view, delicious food specially Khumb k gilawat. Special thanks to Mr.Aniket he made the experience much more worthwhile.üëçüèª
On 18th floor of the Westin, the restaurant offers nice view. But the ambience could be much better and a little more Indianised for the menu on offer. The quantity and quality of food was good but there weren‚Äôt enough servers/waiters. Vrushali was trying to do her best but couldn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre surely understaffed. We had to ask for water many times. Hand wash came before the food but did not come after the food - quite opposite for Indian restaurant.  Kangan needs to employ more people. They need to work on better ambience. When people dine at such place, the food experience matters more than the food. The chef does a good job - but it ends in the kitchen. 4 stars coz I went to eat good food and food was good.

I have fond memories of good food and great conversation at this place. I tried only a few of their menu and it is worth.Peach Iced Tea: A little too sweet, can be asked to tone it down.Kokum Ginger Story: a tangy and healthy drink. Loved it Loaded Nachos: Yummilicious Fettuccine Pesto Cream: We ordered this in spaghetti and added some broccoli, olives and sweet corn. Too good.
on mr Sahu never see serves person like him , gave us best offer !!! Value of money in oberai mall really !!!
Office meet. Casual. Loud music. Did not lower volume even after request. Starter optionslimited but good. Main course very limited. Beer good and mocktail ok. Ambience good.
If you wanna go for having a burger then you should definitely visit BURGER KING. There is no place like burger King to have a perfect yummy burger in the Surrounding. There are much more options available for having different burgers. The name itself has burger in it. The best place till I have ever visited for burgers.

Thanks Madhuri for being absolutely receptive. The two major things that differentiate a coffee shop is the staff and rate chart..!!
Very simple dish but extremely tasty. Freshly cut strawberries with a simple custard and fresh cream was a perfect desert to wrap a weekend
Yashwant and santosh were good at their services individually. Inspite of being less on staff, they attended us very well and also the food made was good.

No taste in food at all. Very poor service. Not to be visited at all
Good veg spread , great service. Worth a visit. Nothing much to crib, although packed house on a Sunday evening. Staff is very helpful with quick service too.

Foodies call alert!!!! Mulund west has got a place which serves you taste for their food and amazing outcountries resembling ambience as well.

The drinks we ordered were :- Temptation Aamsutra Orange twist  All the drinks were really great. The mixture was quite appropriate and tasted real good.  For food we ordered :-  Pav bhavi fondue :- food studio serves the best fondue. Nicely mixed with approriate amount of cheese marinated with onion.  Veg Manchurian  Veggies pizza:- many of the toppings made the pizza taste great  Lasagna - quite cremy and three layered. Chocolate balls- quiet chocolaty  Naan :- It's Very soft.  All the food was very tasty. Loved it. You should surely visit this place.  Food :- 5/5 Service :- 4.5/5 Hygeine :- 5/5 Ambience :- 4.5/5
I highly recommend you this place for milkshakes and desserts. They were delicious, perfect and very pretty. I do not recommend this place for food. I honestly did not like it at all. All the three stars I have given is for milkshakes and desserts. That is really good here. You should try. The ambience is also amazing. But I did not like the food.
The Bake Room ‚ù§Ô∏è  A decent Cake Shop located in Mulund West. I had tried thier Cake for one of my good friend's birthday. It was really good. I can recommend this place if you are looking for decent Cakes.
""
This is great place in mulund to hangout with your loved ones. The ambiance of this cafe very decent and cute. Staff of this cafe is also good. The Bake Room offer really nice range of cakes. They are famous for their 24 heaven cake which is a must try cake. What we had: 1. Thepla tacos 2. Heart melt pizza 3. Oriental crostinni 4 pizza 4. Kitkat milkshake 5. Vadapav bites 6. 24 heaven pastry

Visited here on Saturday for lunch with friends. We tried Jain thali. There ghee roti is just awesome(soft like homemade). You‚Äôll get a variety of sabzi in thali to try. Ambience and service is good.

Pasta was good in taste but quantity was less than what i paid for . Will try some other dishes next time .
See the pic and decide for yourself... It looked like the order was thrown together in a hurry... Too much of unnecessary topping of onions and even the cheese didn't feel authentic in taste. Look at the packaging and delivery... DISAPPOINTING
A cafe situated in Runwals 5 mins from Nahur railroad station. This food cafe situated in Runwal greens tower, Mulund West. The cafe can be effectively situated at Mulund as it unmistakable from the primary street and the structure of Runwal greens is the land mark there. Feel is extremely cool and reviving.  You feel natural once you step in. The cafe serves sandwiches, burgers ,pizza, shakes and so forth. Their shakes are the best. Pizza's and sandwiches are sufficient. Veggies if u can watch are new to the point that it is by all accounts seconds ago taken out from homestead to cook. One of the best spot to joint with loved ones. They served delectable portions and the introduction is so lovely. Do visit this spot atleast once and attempt their different pizzas they offer.
Hotel review:- Playteria one of the best cafe located in mulund west.  wonderful experience even for a non foodie. The components of the menu go well together. Very flavourful menu and so thoughtfully put together.  we ate a lot but there was no ‚Äôrestaurant overload‚Äô feeling.  The menu and the dishes were so well thought of and presented. we were pleasantly surprised at how every dish we tasted¬†  totally fabulous and sublime‚Ä¶ what a gastronomic experience
I liked this place. I had ordered pizzas. It was tasty. However, I was not satisfied with few things and they are as follows:- 1- The ambience was not WOW! It is a very small place. 2- The prices of many food items here are hyped. The quantity that they provide is not sufficient and doesn't match the price. 3- The games available here are not sufficient. As the name suggests focus on variety board games should be given more, but there are 3 or 4 board games which are repeated. My ratings are:- Ambience- 3/5 Food- 3.5/5 Hospitality- 4/5
Visited recently, pizza and pani puri shots are  quite good but their platter was oily so couldn‚Äôt enjoy it much.  Recommend going for their cheesy dishes and avoiding anything fried.
It is situated near the kalidas hall in Mulund west . The place serves a wide variety of food like burger , pizzas, fries, coffee, tea and many more things . Ambiance is quite good and soothing. A perfect place to hangout with Friends or family. One of the most interesting thing about playteria is it has a number of games to play while it takes quite time for the food to be ready . Games like chess , Monopoly, business and what not . It even has a wall art type something which is a true representation of students life which we did find quite amazing . Talking about the food , What we had ?  A combine pizza which was of BBQ panner and pesto :- we did really liked the concept of this pizza they have a whole pizza which consists of 6 slices , 3 of BBQ panner and 3 of pesto. The taste of pizza was ok but , the crust towards end was really hard almost burnt type . Still the rest was amazing taste was also quite ok , not to bad and not too amazing .  Hazelnut frappe:- We really liked the taste of hazelnut frappe. It really was amazing . Quantity was just a bit less for the price but if your budget is more , it's worth a try.  Overall Ambience is quite good , games to play keeps us engaging , they even have a upper section , but the ambiance of that of the lower section is more amazing . Taste :- 4/5 Price :- 4/5 Quantity:-4/5 Ambiance:- 4.5/5 Value for money :-4.5/5  Final verdict:-  If you want to have some amazing time with while playing games you like and enjoy the ambiance and all this place is a must visit ‚ô•Ô∏è
It is nice place to visit.its pizza are tasty and cheezy as hell.the embience was good.the order was served within 15 min.the staff was also nice n kind.it has games to play and spend more time there with friends.The half n half pizza was first time i saw like this means half other pizza other half pizza ( combination of two pizza).the quantity was good n quality also was good.
good for veg people.  ok food nothing so special here.  need to improvise on taste and quality of food.
Ph se food is one amongst the line of restaurants that you can find in the r galleria...boasting of a classy ambience and quick courteous service with the waiters well versed with what they serve....it might get noisy during the weekends...but the host is right there with her team to take care of you...very well maintened ... recommended for family parties... So we ordered food keeping in mind to try out new items Mandarin soup- red broth spicy and tangy you can make out the base of lemon - coriander soup in it...amongst other exotic veggies ..and also pieces of paneer... Warm paneer salad- name itself is intriguing....but wait till you see the presentation!!5 stars for that....paneer was soft and tasty ...well complimenting the veggies... Sizzler- hot and sizzling! The mexican sizzler! Loved the pasta! And the sauce with it....the veggies were well done too It might fall on the expensive side money wise...zomato gold helps a little... Wanting to try their melting bun ...maybe next time?
This has an great ambience‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§the food is quite good. This us specially preferable for the vegetarians ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòóüòôüòóüòôüòô
Please do not waste your time and money here. Not at all worth it! üëé
Ambiance was subtle and they have some vibrant and new dishes, I ordered chhole bhature sizzler.... personally not a fan of veg food but this dish is quite intresting and tasty so must recommend dish 5/5

Worst taste and quantity I will never order again from funky monkey, and I will never recommend anyone to have anything from here. I had a very worst experience, I have never expected this taste from funky monkey......

International food world hotel was known for tasty non veg items and chicken biryani was one of them but presently the quality of almost all items are bad there was no spices or masala in rice and totally dry, I feel like eating kushka with few chicken pieces. They increased the price and quality was low to drain. Pathetic

Worst food i ever had in my life. The chicken was smelly. Chicken Biryani and Chicken Gulzar was very Much Spicy tgough we mentioned NON -SPICY. Rice was very dry. I was about to vomit the moment i has a piece of smelly chicken. May be Rotten Meat was used. i have downloaded zomato just now to write this review. The order was made through my sister‚Äôs account. She does not want her Name to be highlighted so i chose to write my one review on this new own account.

It's very worst what I experience in this restaurant ...service and maintaing people and their way of response in very bad....they asked me extra money for mis matached order...even though I paid...but very experience
I'm eaten boneless chicken biryani many times in suraj fine dine restaurant the taste was superb but Iam ordered boneless chicken biryani through Zomato the food was too bad I taughted is it come from the restaurant or not
Very good place, to come with family and friends have well behaved staff . They offer very delicious food , and the environment will allow you to come out with a smile
its really frustrating to see the quantity of the item thy hav given us. there were just 2 pieces of mutton in gravy tht we hav order worth of 300. that too we hav orderd in a peak situation. hopeless üëé forget about the taste .
I ordered a mutton head curry, it didnt have a single piece with flesh. U served only bones with a very bad taste. No salt no spice. Dont waste our money for ur waste
I have ordered Chicken Lollipop....Actually I requested them make it full dry but received gravy....and that too there is only 2 leg pieces, remaining 4 normal chicken pieces. Disappointed Sorry.... Expecting improvement....
Biryani tastes good. Spicy but The quantity of Rice and Chicken is not balanced. Rice is of huge quantity and Chicken pieces are way less. But at this price you won't regret the taste of biryani. Would love if you improve quantity of pieces.
The quality of food ive recieved is some what not so nice but just okay delivery is nice The restaurant should serve and improve its quality
Awesome restaurant and awesome food as expected love you samrat and love you zomato food is very tasty and chicken also tastyy chicken roasted nice

Had ordered 2 cookie slabs(sort of a brownie) via Zomato. Quality wise it was great, with a perfect combination of crispness at the bottom where it was needed and soft gooey kind of texture within the middle and upper layers. Price wise it may disappoint many, as the size is comparable with the other big brand chain outlets, but slightly reasonable say with Domino's, etc. But then again, I'm no one to complain if there are a certain set of clientele who demand exclusivity at a certain price.
Simply one of the best fresh Cookie parlours, just the best. Nearly unbeatable when it comes to fresh and soft cookies. No matter what your taste buds are like, you'll definitely like at least some of their cookies and desserts.¬†  Ordered : Double chocolate chip cookie Sundae  Taste: 9/10 Service: 9/10 Value for Money: 8.5/10¬† But surely worth it¬† :)
A small place with nice service...I tried Nutella sea salt cookie, Nutella tart and Oreo milkshake...the Nutella tart was upto the mark...Oreo milkshake gets 3/5 also,I had seasalt cookie with Icecream..you have to pay extra for Icecream
Sweetish house Mafia has great cookies , their signature Nutella Sea salt is really a five star specially the salt taste ..  This time I had the double chocolate cookie which was nice , also tried their sea salt brownie though I really found this brownie OK it was pretty dry  The salt and the Nutella covered up the dryness .. they should improve a little
Ambiance is good but the food can be better. Also there's no alcohol. Service is great. That's the tandoori prawns chipotle. Rates are a bit high but still not very high!
Been here for dinner party last weekend. It's in a corporate office building space in South Bombay and so it was quite easy to find.  The first thing I loved in the place the moment I entered was the ambience. They had an al fresco setting as well as indoor seating. The night was pleasantly cool and so preferred sitting outside; it was incredible.  They also had great service, especially the bar keep. They were polite, courteous and they made it a point to try and remember what we were having, when i went for a repeat.  The food was strictly okay though. Not bad for certain, but not something I'd be ga ga about.  Overall, a nice romantic place for a special date night but not for those who are looking all about food. I would like to give it a try once again, until then 3 star (would've given 3.5 if I had the option) is my rating
Great place for hosting cocktails! Has a brilliant outdoor set up with excellent catering and extremely helpful staff strength. Has an inside set up too for dancing or any indoor celebration. Music is good too.
I had ordered for watermelon feta cheese mint salad. The taste of the salad was delicious however the quantity could be better. Also, the staff who takes the online order should be a little more cautious about the customer contact details being captured for the order. It would save time for both the delivery person and the customer. For my order incorrect contact details were updated due to which I had to wait for more than an hour for the food and the delivery person also had to wait for more than 45 mins...
I love this place the ambience, food, quatity, quality as well as taste. The food is just perfect and healthy. I have always being their during office lunch hours for a buffet. Must go and enjoy the the real taste of food.

This place is located in N M Joshi Marg, Lower Parel, Mumbai. Loved the place from the entrance to the sitting the place was in a perfect theme. Loved the concept that the place offers to you. Interiors are just amazing. Superb staff giving you a pleasant service like never seen before. My pickings from their menu are:- 1. VEG SPRING ROLL 2. CHILLY GARLIC CHICKEN WINGS 3. CHICKEN MANCHURIAN DRY 4. HAKKA NOODLES 5. CHICKEN MOMO-STEAMED 6. HOT GARLIC PRAWNS 7. HAKKA PANEER 8. CHILLI BEAN 9. EGG FRIED RICE  Overall, the place was amazing you must try it specially with you family.
I recently ordered a food from pan of Asia. Waiting for try out some unique tasty foods and value for money then you must try out pan of asia. I had ordered a chicken gyoza and honey chilli patato. It was really well cooked with perfect flavour and quality and quantity was also good. I get delivery before time with hot food. Price were also responsible. Highly recommended.
Pan of asia has lit ambience located at Vile parle!!!Just loved the vibes there ,lights and everything!!!  They have good seating space We ordered Sweet corn soup Noodles soup  Hot garlic prawns which is hidden gem here!!  The spices and taste was so tempting!!!  Chilly panner  Burnt garlic rice  Black bean meal was something we loved Loved presentation  Also service was humble .  Planning to get here again
The restaurant is located near my house and i usually order a lot from this restaurant. It is really worth ordering from here. My order was of panner chilli and panner spring roll. Both the items were really tasty. Panner roll was really tasty. I really liked it. It was medium spicy but the panner was really very soft to eat. The spices in it were really making me more hungry to eat. It was really a worthfull experience to order.
Pan of asia two delivery outlet in mumbai one is lower Parel and one in Nariman point, this is only delivery kitchen, i order here some asian food, food quality is the best and authentic taste, I order red curry with steam rice, and chilli garlic chicken wings, rice and the red curry was really delicious and the quality is good, the food was served fresh, also the chicken wings is mouthwatering, chilli garlic combination in wings was really tasty, I really thank full to this place to serving delicious food.
All they could say is ‚Äúsorry‚Äù. Did not offer to replace it. Almost broke my teeth trying to eat the pizza. Quality has gone down to a point of no return.

One of the best pizza by the slice in town   This place is a must order
Ordered pizza from here for lunch .I ordered bowling fire pizza .It was loaded with topping of tandoori paneer ,green capsicum,onion, mushroom and jalapenos.The pizza was cold and it was not so good in taste.The base was thick and it was sweet as tomato sauce was added in the base ,it was not spicy .Disappointed .I will not order again from this restaurant .
Average New York style pizza slice .the cheese was good but the dough was a bit soggy
A very good italian good is available at this place. Do try thier burgers, they have very good burgers. The food is awesome at this place. Must visit place
This place serves food at affordable prices !! They delivers food to your door infact this place is located in Parel !! Their quality and quantity of food is nice !! This cafe meal box is very pocket friendly !! Big thumps up for this place !!
Good food quality  Healthy and hygiene  Complete meal it is sufficient for 2 persons   Egg and burger,cake and other product quality is extremely valuable
CAFE MEAL BOX - Good trustworthy food. You can definitely vouch on the food quality and quantity. The service is very swift, many a times they run out of burgers and sandwich it seems they make limited quantity of that. So I missed on it but will definitely try next time. The pasta here is amazing mainly the white sauce with chickenüòçüòç. Have tried veg strognoff with rice, paneer ratatouille, paneer bbq garlic and pesto cottage cheese.

Ladu Samrat- Parel, Mumbai I have been visiting ladu Samrat since 2005 and till date my favourite item here is Batatawada. The taste is the same no changes. Moreover it is affordable. They serve quantity and quality. Should visit this place if nearby to lalbaug, Parel, Lower Parel
The food have a delicious taste of Maharashtra. You will get Marathi vibes there. All kind if Maharashtra food are there. It feels like home . Good place to go with your entire family.
Good experience the bartenders were very friendly and the mocktails were amazing food was okishh can be done better the ambience was awesome
The menu is short n not very intresting , but the chopper rice is the best i usually visit this place for that n recommend ppl if they wanna have a full mean in a single dish. Its chicken in chinese style at the top with schezwan rice below n an half fry with some crisp ‚ù§Ô∏èüòãreally yummy ü§§
The food was Okay. But when divided within 12-13 people the cost pp came upto 500-600 by using gold. Thanks to Zomato gold, even experimenting with food taste is worth the money spent
FLYP .... what to say ... Amazing Ambience, food , live music  , drinks  & Friends what else you need. üòÑ This place is Fam Jam üíÉüèª. A must must visit in kamala mills one of the best happening place in this location.
This place is an excellent party spot. Cafe has very good crowd especially after the office hours. Very well lit with good music making it one of the best choices for office parties.
The best part of the place is ambience. It feels like we are sitting in the woods. The draught beer was great but slightly on the expensive side.  The best part of this place was pizza soaked in Jim beam whiskey. The server put the whiskey on the pizza and then set fire to it. It looked really nice and tasted also good.  My second visit to the place however was not so good as the staff was a bit less forthcoming. Hopefully it was a one off scene.
A nice open space, tough to find an alternate in mumbai, especially the vicinity.   The downside is I was there on the month of April. And the summer heat is too harsh (though they do have fans and portable coolers) it doesn‚Äôt help if the day is just warm.   We had zomato gold and hence could get 2+2 on drinks.  Red wine sangria - on a date, and the vibe - Sangria was the best option. The wine was good, good amount of apple. A little dry for my taste, not sure if there was any sweetener added to just lift the drink. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  Homemade Nachos- large portion, and was very filling. I loved the sour cream on top, something I don‚Äôt see often. Also opted for the option of Chicken tikka, which I asked on the side and not on the top.   Special mention ‚Äî the chicken tikka was the winner. Nice and spicy, it was cooked well. Being a desi I loved this more than the nachos. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  Service was top notch again. Have to mention the staff came over couple of times asking if everything was fine. Loved the touch of care. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  Overall a  ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ ‚Äî the heat and seating arrangment was awkward (we did not get the air from the cooler nor the fan right on us)
Had Been to this place In Jan 2019, amazing Brunch great choice of cocktails and Food..they dont deny any special request...hope this place reopens soon..their flavored LIT, botanical garden, trio paneer, drunken drumsticks were amazin..hope to see you guys soon with a Bang.

The ambiance of burn is very good  There is dance floor to enjoy the beats.The seating arrangement and tables are also in  Systematic way. The tables and the sofas are also clean. The food is also good in taste. The  prices of liquor are also reasonable as Compare to other restaurants. The quantity of the food is also good enough. Service is also good. The staff members are good in behaviour.

Small portions of food (ordered sizzler) which could hardly serve one person. Paneer was unfresh as it was hard. The managers (especially the lady) was loud and felt like hovering instead of being subtle with their conversation and behavior with other workers. Poor location.
Location is very bad. Right in the middle of slums. Wonder how our has 4.2 rating. We didn't go just came back.
They come up with stuff like Zomato Gold not allowed on weekends and stuff like that. The lady bouncer or manager has a diva like behavior and does not have basic decency or courteousness when talking to guests.  The portions served are extremely paltry, had ordered Stroganoff and Pan Seared Basa. Taste good. Drinks are fairly priced. Music is uncomfortably loud. Service is slow at the bar. The bartenders choose to do ancillary things while the other one is busy and not serve the guest rather.  Would have rated higher if not for boorish staff behaviour. Never recommending neither going again. We usually take the business on Saturday nights to Dive next door and would continue to do so.  0 for staff manners and behaviour.  Would have rated higher if not for
I visited this place yesterday, food was really tasty . I was satisfied like the food was healthy and way of delivering was fantastic, you can also order at your on place , and price is also good. This place if highly recommended. Will make sure to visit again

The ambience of this place is mind blowing...brings one close to the marwadi/Gujarati culture. Also, the traditional Rajasthani food available here is quite satisfying. On Tuesdays there's a special offer for lunch thali also.
A great place for a date or hangout with friends. Lovely ambience with live music. Really liked the pizza, chicken salad and drink.

If there is some place which makes pasta and pizza close to what you get in Italy its , pizza express , it's a must visit place for all pizza and pasta lovers , my first 5* rating place , believe me u have to be there to know it, it's liits are as good as it gets. Staff and Ambience is also pretty good..
Visited this place for the 1st tym loved the pizza and pasta. Pushpa was great too with the service. Good job
I visited their Powai branch, it‚Äôs a nice cozy place with great music and ambience. Staff is really friendly and courteous with their prompt service even though it was crowded at 1pm.   What we ordered :  For drinks ‚Ä¢ CALIFORNIA- It was refreshing and tasted like bubble gum. Rate 4/5  ‚Ä¢ HOME MADE SANGRIA - We tried it for the first time, we still got to develop the taste for it. So if you are into sangrias then Its a GO for you!! Rate 4/5  Food  ‚Ä¢PHILADELPHIA MELTING CHICKEN STEAK - Its super yummy and filling. It comes with fries,chicken topped with an omelette ,cheese sauce and a lot of veggies. Rate 5/5  ‚Ä¢ SIZZLING FAJITAS - We combined it with SEARED SHRIMP and GRILLED CHICKEN also it came along with three tortillas out of which we only ate 2 also they gave us the salsa, cheese, mayo, avacodo etc . The shrimp and chicken was good we didn‚Äôt eat the veggies as they were too oily.Not worth the hype.  Rate 3/5   P.S- MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE and CHEESE CAKE are totally drooling. MUST TRY!!
The service is good specially was served by Vishal, he was good with suggestions on the menu and helpful with refills through out
Vishal and Abani were very courteous and friendly. Good customer service and food is amazing as always.
Good food n good service by abani
Thanks vishal to service is the very good thankss
Always a pleasure to visit this place. The service is friendly and prompt. Their food is always hot and fresh. I highly recommend their pasta. They have a good selection of desserts as well. Perfect for a pit stop after a gruelling shopping sessionüòã
Talking about the ambience first , it's a good soothing ambience perfect for a brunch with friends or family! The staff was good. As the place was not much crowded when we were there so the staff attended us well. Coffee house and u don't try a coffee? well must try the GUNLINE COFFE amazing flavor,loved it. Then we tried the healthy combo which had omelette and bowl of fruits. The omelette was Good too. The pasta was unlike other Alfredo pasta.
Its a lovely place with great ambience and the food is good overall with great music , it's a good place to hangout with friends or a date for some brunch The staff is super friendly as well and this place provides great coffee too , in frame - Irish coffee with cream
One of the Best Places i have ever visited. The staff is polite and Friendly. The ambience is pretty good and spacious. I ordered 1 Alfredo Penne pasta & the garlic bread with pasta was delicious. Also i ordered one Egg meal with bowl of fruits & Gunline coffee & oreo mud pie which were also delicious. Overall must visit place.
Fully loaded sandwich!! Yum!! Good ambience! U can spend long hours with your loved ones... Cold coffee was nice! Grilled chicken with rice was good, could have been better!!

There was a cockroach in the food. We ordered chicken wings.. and found a cockroach in the masala... They changed the dish but I will never ever be going back there. And will advise that nobody else goes there again. The staff are rude and pretended that the cockroach in the food was no big deal.
Had ordered paneer achari masala and BB fried chicken. The panner achari masala was okayish. The batter and paneer were undercooked. BB fried chicken was not something I expected. The ambience is quiet cozy but the service was a little dull and the people didn't seem interested.
Bar bar is located in Phoenix market city Kurla . It a happening place with young crowd & it‚Äôs almost full on week ends . Has lot of variety to offer in food as well .  A nice place in the busy shopping mall .
Bar Bar is really a great place for someone looking for good drinks, great food, amazing ambience. You are even presented a certificate which is actually your food and drink bill. We got the veg sizzlers and a chicken starter which made my night and I picked the drink for the night with the awesome options available on the menu. I'm definitely going to visit you again and again. You made my visit memorable. Thanks for that.

Appreciate the fabulous courtesy provided by theManager Vineet. On our request he simply took back a dish and prepared it once again this time himself and made it to the liking of our palate. Amazing gesture and will surely recommend this place to others who want to feel wanted and welcomeüëçüëç
Tried pizza and pasta! Pizza was okayish! Didn't like the crust much . . Pasta was amazing with great texture

Grandmama‚Äôs Cafe is wonderful with delicious taste of food .Their pizza was mouth watering and tasty. Surely recommended for parties or friends time .  The service can be improved , overall amazing place to visit.

It is always mesmerizing to have a beach view with the setting sun. Well this place is a perfect place to be at when you want such view. It is quite a sophisticated place known for its authentic food. We ordered a Mezze Platter. Crispy bread came with Avocado hummus, sun dried tomato pesto and various other dips. It was totally a treat for us with all the different flavours of dips. We also tried Mille Feuille - a classic French pastry. Something very different. It comes with a seasonal fruit, being peach in our case, whipped cream- all sandwiched between crispy pastry. Would rate the dessert 3/5. Staff is very courteous. It was a lovely experience and would love to visit again.
We just sat there for hours looking at the sunset and enjoying our food and drinks. Would totally recommend it.
Staff charged us for an extra beer globe and was not willing to listen to us when we complained. They refused to check CCTV footage when we asked them to. This has happened to some of our friends in the past at 3WM and now we experienced it for ourselves. Please don‚Äôt visit here
Amazing place for dates. Ambience is great.we ordered - veg exotica sizzler - really one of the best i've had. the rice was not overcooked. the veggies were really fresh and had a taste in between of raw and cooked (thats how sizzlers should be) the sauce went very well with the dish. quantity was great and they provided a lot of items in sizzlers. must try.¬†spaghetti in white sauce - very cheesy and creamy. delicious and came with two garlic breads which was also roasted properly. the quantity was great. one of the best i've had.we ordered drinks. we had gone in happy hour so we got drinks on 1 + 1¬†atmosphere is really chill with good music. excellent service.
If you want to go to a place where the music will drown out your thoughts this is it. Haha. Its a great place to hang out with your friends and serves up a good Chili Chicken in my opinion. Used to be a haunt for some of my friends when they were in college and we still go there to get the party started. :) They also have a karaoke night!
This place has good music and is not heavy on the pockets as well..Has great variety to offer on the food and the drinks menu! Located near Khar station, its easy to locate and serves great munchies as well..!!

JUSS SINDHFUL by Kanchan and Deepak Ahuja, is a beautiful attempt at food revival of cuisines that come from the soul of our country. Sindhi food is made here to perfection following kanchan's family heirloom recipes. It all started from her home kitchen, hearty Sindhi meals that she created we're loved so much that in time they found place in this lively, family run restaurant. Two years old JUSS SINDHFUL is supported by their catering and delivery outlet called SINDHFUL,which stands just across the road. It delivers any of the 312 dishes that you can order within a radius of 6 kms. This hot kitchen has catered Sindhi food to many a celebrity weddings and celebrations. Prominently among them were Dipika-Ranveer nuptials,where in SINDHFUL chefs were especially flown to Italy to cook and lay out a large Sindhi food spread. Within the comforting interiors of the restaraunt me and my dear college friend enjoyed a multi course Sindhi menu. Freshly made, each dish had a distinct flavour just like that of home and a marked presentation. See a detailed description to what we ate, in the pictures attached below ! #fbaisecretsanta #jusssindhfull #foodreview #sindhicusine #sindhful #khar @jusssindhfull
it is knoow for its amazing food, better sitting arrangement and cool ambience. by its name, basically its a sindhi restaurant serves lip smacking sindhi style food. the food quality and quantity wisely it was very filling and the pricing is also decent. definitely a value for money
Considering the price of Sindhi curry-rice (320), the least I expected was a good variety of vegetables used- Sindhi curry tasted below average.

One of myvfavorite places  in Bandra... super chill vibe, love the jazz GOT music that they play. Staff is very friendly and the cocktails yumm!!
Firstly the place's USP is the ambience, good vibes and nice music. The food is okayish but the alcohol is not the best, serves alcohol which seems like it's been adulterated, even the mixers were flat but they were not charged. One thing this place really needs is better management, the waiters were grumpy, food wasn't hot when brought to the table, my rum was mixed with a flag Coke, when spoke to the waiter, he just picked up the glass and walked away....
I went there on a live Sufi night featuring Aaryan Tiwari , the place inside was good cosy and done up well , we had drinks there as were enjoying the live band , The outside sitting was so good with the pleasant weather.. would sure go again for the music and taste some food
Decent and cozy . The food was quite nice as well. Good place to just casually unwind with friends . Not very expensive either . A nice place overall!!üòä
I visited Urban Street Cafe under recommendation of my friends who were just raving about the food. Nestled very close to Khar station yet nicely in a quiet spot, this place is more like hidden gem. While is the place is quaint it does offer and inside and outside seating area. The food was really delicious. Even a non vegetarian like me enjoyed myself thoroughly.  I tried  Chipotle Mexican rice bowl- delicious! It is like a layered rice which cheese nachos Chipotle and so much goodness. It has some really nice veggies and that itself makes it a plethora of textures in the mouth. Excellent I highly recommend you try this.  Paneer Shwarma- Right from the beginning of the first bite of the Shwarma to the last fight I just could not get enough. It was so tasty. The humus and the sauce inside we just tantalizing my tastebuds.  Hot chocolate- since it got late at night we decided to indulge in hot chocolate as it's winter in Bombay, and they had made a fantastic brew. So delicious I totally recommend.  I also tried a newly introduced sizzler.  Sizzling exotic veggies in garlic brown sauce.- It was smoky and delicious the rice fries wedges complimented each other perfectly. Totally recommended. We shared it between 2 people as the quantity was good.  Lastly we tried the pesto hummus with toasted pita bread- this is definitely worth being a signature dish of a place. It was incredibly tasty. I just could not get enough. They have fusion of pesto into hummus and the creation is excellent. You have to try this.  If you ask me Urban Street Cafe Khar is definitely a place worth checking out.  In fact if you can't go there definitely call for delivery it's an experience that a foodie will remember and cherish.
This cafe is a gem for vegetarian food. Everything I eat here turns to be my favourite. Best place around bandra Khar. So, here‚Äôs what all I had to far Mexican rice with masala beans & nachos, corn & popeye cheese burger, stir fried veggies in Kung pao with noodles, crunchy panner burger, kalakhata mojito.

The Sicilian pizza, though good, wasn't upto the mark. It felt like it was dipped in oil. The taste was ok but too salty for my like. The restaurant was supposed to be closing maybe, so they hurried, because they didn't have any of the stuff available to order baring few. Not a great experience but not an experience whose rating should be taken into account.
Little Italy is a fine vegetarian Italian restaurant which resides on the main road Juhu Tara road, bang opposite Juhu beach and near Kishore Kumar bungalow. It‚Äôs an ideal for family gatherings and celebrations.  I love how they‚Äôve kept their menu so extensive, serving not only Italian but as well as Mexican and Lebanese.   So yes they do serve Hummus and Pita which was my favourite here. Yummy and smooth as silk hummus with olive oil topped with black olives served with warm pita breads.   For starters you can order their sizzling hot Spinach Salsa dip which is served with mini toasts, which you can dip and have. It‚Äôs a great snack to munch on in the start.  Pizza Napoli is one of their best sellers and it was amazing. Topped with a lot of fresh and nicely cooked veggies, and lotsa cheese just like I love. The thin crust pizza base is what added the main element to the pizza.  Pasta Barbaresca was the best spaghetti pasta I‚Äôve had till date. It‚Äôs loaded with white sauce and fine veggies like broccoli bell peppers. It was saucy and cheesy and tasty.  Cannelloni Alla Fioren is again my favourite. Go for it if you‚Äôre a fan of cheesy stuffed pastas. Pasta sheets packed with ricotta cheese and spinach, my favourite combo, topped with alot of cheese. Cheese lovers gonna love this!!!  At the end, being extremely full with all the cheesy dishes, I still couldn‚Äôt miss out on the desserts and called for their Blueberry Cheesecake which was airy and fluffy topped with blueberry compote. I loved it!!
Little Italy- Easy to locate amd hard to leave the place! One of the best dine in place you can find in juhu. Place really has the best vibe as you'll see place populated by many people in and out, on a regular weekday. The people kept coming and the place has plenty of accommodation to host everyone and with amazingly quick service and polite staff. The order get on your table in 10-15 mins after you order with excellent taste. The place has various cuisine too choose from. The menu is so big that it will take almost 10-15 visit to finish everything in the menu. Surely you can visit it everyday and you can try any new thing you desire. We ordered :- Crostini rustini Pale di patato Cheese founde Mini zatar rolls Pizza mellino Mocktails:- Dead woman walking Nice-N-Naughty Fizzy fiz Peach please Dessert:- Chocolate bomb Ferero rocher mouse cake Sizzling brownie with ice cream
"Food: 5/5 Loved the food. Absolutely amazing presentation and very fresh yummy and satisfying. The stand out for me was the cannaloni as it was delicious and filling. As far as the mocktail was concerned, ""dead women walking"" stood out. Wonderful chilled drink with a tinge of lime. Ambiance: 5/5 Crazy and lovely interiors with great theme to go with. A wonderful decor and good seating space. Service: Quick, clean and well mannered. The staff knew exactly how a dish should be served and thus very humble. Overall loved every bit. Reasonable for the price as the quantity is good too. Worth it. Would like to visit again. Thanks."

We found no reason for the average to be a 4 out of a 5! Whatever you expect from this restaurant it fulfills.. one of the most fulfilling restaurants i have ever been to.. a perfect 5 star üåü‚ù§Ô∏è
Mac and cheese has been the saviour to all our hunger pangs one too many times and being so, it has also been subjected to a variety of twists and fusions. Presenting the Mac and Cheese Lollipop from Third Eye Cafe, Vashi which is crispy from the outside filled with the goodness of Mac and Cheese. Another one from the chef's kitchen, The Cottage Cheese Picante Sizzler was also a fiery delight and did not disappoint.
I've visited this place quite a few times now, earlier they had zomato 1+1 offer idk why they removed it now. But still a great place to go to have a pleasant evening.  Staff is quite friendly here, also their service is fast. Must have's here - Chicken rozali tikka Kung Pao chicken  . . . . Follow my journey on Instagram üëâ @thathungryengineer

Qilla da vashi is a first castle restaurant to get opened at vashi.They serve some amazing mughlai food and are known for their mutton dishes.  They also came up continental and Chinese food in their menu.  In frame veg Qilla da special, veg platter, mexican sizzler, naan and drinks. Their Subz is a must try and is their signature dish!  Tomato gravy cooked with exotic spices and mix vegetables and was served with butter naan.No doubt the Subz had a smokiness in it.
The staff is extremely confused and laid-back leading to a very late and delayed service. The food is extremely ordinary definitely not value the money. Nihari is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Least recommendation to.come here and eat.

Writing a late review for this outlet in Satra plaza, Vashi. Poptates has always been my personal favorite to hang out with friends and eat sizzlers. I wanted to order their veggie √† la kiev sizzler but it wasn't available, that was a real mood killer. Then I ordered grilled chicken and exotic veggies sizzler, both were average. Also ordered OMG nachos. Quantity of this was good.

Bombay barbeque is one of my favorite places to visit in Navi Mumbai. I have been there many times ..and the food is just delicious. The ambience, the service everything is just awesome. Bit on a costly side but guys it's definitely worth it trust me!
Bombay barbecue the name itself spells barbecue cuisine at its best!!  Situated at Satara plaza, you definitely have to try the buffet spread served over here, it‚Äôs too good!! Really enjoyed the kulcha n chole it was delicious.  Beautiful decor and amazing dining experience. Staff is very down to earth as we visited this place for the first time they were more then happy to make us understand the concept of their bbq system!! Since we were in a hurry and din‚Äôt had much time to relish most of the dishes but whatever we did were very very good!! Detailed review of the entire food will be updated pretty soon!!
Perfect place for parties. Chivalrous staff with prompt service. The variaties of desserts were ample. There were good amount of options for vegetarians as well. Loved their live menus.

Located in Satra Plaza, Vashi, The Public Co is an amazing place to chill out with your friends and have a good time after work.  We ordered a couple of beers, some martinis and fries and wedges with it, the service was good but a little bit slow. The live music was great, had an amazing weekend overall.
I had high hopes read the reviews of this place but this place sucked big time. Quality of food was a question, as the food smelled bad and tasted stale. Service of this place also was so slow that it took 20-30 for a dish for the only table occupied in this restaurant. I don't recommend this place at all.
last week i visited here with my family for having dinner. this restaurant is in satra plaza on palm beach road vashi. Ambience is so nice and seatings are also good. maintainance and cleanliness is properly maintained. service provided by them was so nice and fast. their interaction with us was so nice and also they helped us in selecting menu.¬† talking about food,¬† quality of food is so nice and is also hygiene. mocktails and starters that we tried was so tasty. the uniqueness about the food was in desserts that was white chocklate sizzling brownie which was so tasty and delicious. overall we enjoyed the dinner and their service.
With a lot of seating available this place is best suited for luxury dinning and live streaming as well. Ambience is quite good. Place is calm & not very loud music. Food was extremely good. Rates were too cheap. Not very packed as i had visited this place in the afternoon.
Very yummy dishes especially sizzler,and desserts..
when you entered in the food studio, they try to recognise d you are a gold member or not. then they tell each other he or she has a gold membership. after that they treated like u are not profitable for them. if you try to ordere some drinks, the guy who serve you, insists / offer some flavoured in your selected menu, if you change the flavour which not in their menu, be ready to pay all the four drinks you ordered...  The server management people eyes says you all what they think about gold members..... Bad experience

Special thanks to the manager/hostess . We ( party of seven ) were about to bolt , surveying the teeming crowd and populated tables , but she got us a table immediately. And then checked on us all through out the lunch . This kind of service , though not rare , is certainly  not easy to come by. Food was very tasty though we did have to wait for second rounds .
Ambience - 4.3/5  At night, the tanjore tiffin room becomes a great spot for a date with its dim lights and candle-lit tables.  Service - 5/5  Top-notch service. Everyone working here was really kind and helpful. Mr. Gerald deserves a special mention for taking really good care of our table.  Food - 4.5/5  Pepper chicken - Simple, no-nonsense appetiser. Tender perfectly cooked and seasoned chicken.  For the mains, they bring you a curry sampler that lets you try all the curries they have to offer. These are the ones I tried :-  Mushroom Chettinad with Appam - One of the best Chettinad gravies I've eaten in the city.  Madras Railway chicken curry with idiappam - This cashew and coconut based gravy was so rich and delicious. Each bite left me wanting more.  Besides Appam and idiappam, they also have several types of rice that you could opt for.  Mysore pak - This is the only food item they don't make in-house. I found it a bit too sweet, but that's just how Mysore Pak is.  Payasam - A light kheer-like dessert that works if you don't want something too sweet.  Value for money - 5/5  Score - 4.7/5
Loved the furniture selections and cozy placements. Gives amazing vibe to the restaurant and boosts the experience in the space.

Well Hindering over in Andheri finding a good Buffet place we landed into Global Buffet - Svenska Design . This place was sooo damn lovely. Amazing interiors and mesmerising decor. The food was soo tasty and there was soo much to eat. Kind of cheaper than the other Good Buffet places you‚Äôll find out there in the area. Totallyy filling for the price they are serving. With All bellies full , we got into Bed‚ú®
Food is very nice - I like starters
Food was delicious staff was very good n especially Nilesh .  Nilesh is among the best staff in svenska . I like to come here very often , just love all their delicacies from starters to desserts.
It was a fun experience.. Overall 3.5 out of 5 for food. 4.5/5 for service. 5/5 for courteous staff. Mr. NILESH our server was very kind soft spoken and well mannered he really made it a point that we all have the best dinning experience.
Niles was very courteous and helpful. Overall good ambience and hospitality

Never thought of visiting this place but I did and it was amazing. Why you ask? 1- different concept , 2- vegan food. Will turn into a vegan very soon. Well I can right now also but my profession is stopping me from that Soo can't help it. Anyway personal details aside so the food at jamjar diner really shocked me because of what I had ordered which was vegan Margherita that tasted just like a normal Margherita pizza with some minor changes Soo it's a really good alternative for meat eaters or other people too. Really good place for one to visit. Peaceful place but wasn't satisfied with the seating arrangement but I would rate it 5 because it was unplanned visit with a beautiful soul :) I usually don't revisit the places I have been to but I would definitely come back.

Perfect to fill up your cravings

Not all dishes were great but loved satay and yes service too slow to have one order arrive on the table.  Staff is good but delay was disappointment as if your really starving don‚Äôt expect food on time.
They have displayed on Zomato that the place is open and it is shut. We came all the way from Andheri east and saw it shut. Please update the timings properly from next time.
Service and Ambiance: This is a small place; but i really like their decor; they have done some nice work with assorted plates. Sitting is bit cramped though. They also have UNO cards to play while you are waiting fr your order. Service is courteous.  Food: This is good place for budget friendly chinese food and yes, you get good dimsums here!!! Few dishes to try - veg stuffed dimsums, manchow soup and triple schewan.  VFM: YES Absolutely!!
Very amazing food and staff was also very polite.Do visit this place once for sure.They had amazing variety of Dimsu and also combination of all of it.Di order it's combined Dimsu.
Dimsum and more gives you a refreshing experience while trying out some authentic continental food. Recommendations : Spicy sea food soup Chicken dumplings
The place is located near andheri station is the best place to visit with your loved ones. The ambience is very pleasant and nice. The staff were very humble and polite. The dishes we had were Mocktails : Fruit punch Starters : Hot pan paneer Cheese chilli seekh kebab Mains: Italian pav bhaji Pebento Rice Hawai pizza Dessert: Dhudhi halva
Ordered Tadiwala Murg, Dal makhani, Veg Manza for home delivery.  The packaging was secure, the quality adequate, the flavors were great too.  My only disappointment was that I found the chicken gravy as well as the dal a bit too thin.  The dal makhani was well cooked. Wish they hadn't made it sweet like the Gujarati dals.  All in all a great meal

One of the finest restaurants in vile Parle . Must visit
Aquafire restaurant is located 5 to 10 mins from Vileparle Station. Restaurant has ample space for dining and parking as well. We had ordered harissa chkn , prawns kadipatta and cheese chilli seekh kebab in starters. Prawns kadipatta was nice spicy and different. They have a special dish called Italian pav bhaji a must try. Another speciality is Malbari paratha which can be tried with any nonveg gravy items. Ended our dinner with hot and sweet doodhi ka halwa ....totally satisfied with their quality of food and service....loved it.
""
Awesome!!
Lunch set menu is worth of price. Amm panha is delicious. Kharwas must try maharashtrian sweet.
I've been visiting this place since I was a child and their taste hasn't change a bit. The dosa tastes delicious and the sambar and chutney just go perfectly together. Generally, I eat masala dosa and filter coffee and I am full. The dosas are big and the stuffing is also tasty. This place is near the vile parle station and is a great place for breakfast.
Very reasonable. Good quality. Fresh food.
""
I ordered Thai curry .online order. Find very very less in quantity, not enough for one person also. Highly disappointed.
""
Extremely bad service. I tried being polite during my visit but now it needs to be addressed here. After waiting for so long.. we get the food, which is bad in taste, pasta seamed uncooked and the ice tea was served in paper cups.. and when we told the person concerned and the manager .. he said .. it cant be changed and just w‚Äôl add sugar and give.. the entire lunch got spoiled after paying 1500rs for something and somewhere, where people weren‚Äôt even polite to make it better and serve.
Budget friendly and nice place to eat
Amongst so many ‚Äúpseudo‚Äù healthy food joints, this truly serves super healthy and delicious food!! Preparation is verbatim without cutting corners on quality of ingredients. Ordered thrice from here and every single dish stands apart! Great job
We ordered Udon Noodles, Greenhouse Flat bread and Soya Keema Pav (recommended by staff). Everything was really delicious and healthy. Haven for people who want to be experimentative as well as live guilt free.
Wish I could exceed my stars and not limit it to 5. Its a must try, till now we have made 4 visits and since then we have been trying their menu for the options listed, we have become a big fan of Garde Manger. Their staff is very polite and also very knowledable about the food served. Every second day I get a craving now to go to Garde Manger and try other item on the list. The quality of food and material use is way too high to the price they charge.
""
Amazing place with healthy food and good service plz highly recommended place to visit
This place is close to airport and located a bit in the interior. Ambience is classy old types and looks rich. Salads and deserts were great, bit disappointed on main course as the tastes were not very great. The restaurant was overly crowded with majorly flight crew and two-three big groups of guests (accommodated within hotel), so it was literally a hardcore buffet only experience.
It was a wonderful experience and great service given by your staff Mr Rahul. Excellent customer service very happy and you should hire more staff like him it‚Äôs just wow.. keep smiling all the time . Thank you soo much üòÅ
Lovely food you can try any dish all awesome Staff is very cooperative special thanx to hotel staff HEMA karishma Rahul for the hospitality
Rahul&Karishma. Both r very pleasant and courteous. Keep the good work.
Staff was very polite and helpful specially thanks for Mr Rahul , Miss Karishma given good service for us,Food was also Good
The place has a good ambience but the quantity of the food makes you want to order more. Pretty expensive. Food was ok. Had to order three starters, two main course and dessert to make the stomach full between three people.
The Shack is a pocket-friendly restaurant in Vile Parle East. They serve variety of food. Must try - Sizzlers and appetizers. Ambience is nice. Will definitely visit this place soon.
""
We really liked the food at the Shack in terms of the taste and variety they have to offer. The service is very quick and staff is polite.. Definitely worth a visit!
This place is shit, they wont even apologize for any inconvenience caused to the customer. I posted a review of my experience there and they removed the post after replying in very unprofessional manner. I don't think this place will go on for a very long time with this kind of attitude. Uploading the reply of the management so that you guys don't waste your money at this place.
Gajalee is well known restaurant for sea food. However it is overpriced.  Taste wise it's good. However considering the price charged it's not worth it.
""
Love this place, food is amazing.Clam Koshimbir & Stuffed bombil is to die for. However, over the years the portion size has reduced., and servers with a smile never hurt anybody.  but FOOD IS SOOO GOOD
I went with high expectation but wasn't up-to the mark  1) Well we had guest on our table, couple of cockroaches , Yes!!¬† when told to management response was really bad, after raising lil voice , manager came and apologies , I had came with family and it was such an embarrassment.¬†  2) I had prior reservation but when we arrived waiters were confused to find appropriate table. We had to change table twice while entire place was empty.  3) Main course - pomfret ,Surmai thali , Prawns and Tisrya Masala(Clams) , Boneless Crab green chilli,¬†Desert - 2 pastries n fruit custard ¬† ¬†Thali -¬† (each costing 500) -¬† There was pomfret n Surmai curry (and NO fried pomfret/Surmai ) ,rice, 2 chapati and sabji , I mean if fish is said to be specialty of restaurant then they had to offer fry fish in thali. Well there was bombil fry (Come on are u really giving me bombil¬† for 500 worth thali !?!?! I'm fish lover and have tried many restaurants but this is first place where¬† fry fish wasn't served in thali )¬†  Prawns¬† Masala¬† - It was good but considering price of it there were hardly 5-6 Prawns .  Clams Masala - It was good  Last - Boneless Crab green chilli - They serve one big crab per Kg basis . We had ordered one. Crab meat was cooked separately n served , it was tasty but not per expectation, quantity as per price was very less because this one Crab costed 3500/- (Yes!!! not kidding!!)¬† Do not order desert here!! Fruit custard had only banana.  Total bill - 5.6K for 5 ppl.¬†  Ambiance and service was average, just like local restaurant¬†¬† if u have fish craving try other restaurant¬† because for this cost you will get feast there.
""
This place is very pretty and has a very nice ambience...the cheese poppers were super cheesy tha margerita pizzza was average a little costly but not much but amazing in taste and quick service :)

the taste of the food was bad, the food served was stale, coke was flat. Won't recommend this place at all
We ordered penne pasta (mixed sauce) and thin crust farm house pizza and both were amazing and super yummy. But the only down point I found was they did not provide ketchup with pizza and the pizza was cold as ice üò° but still it tasted amazing. I feel they should consider it
""
PASTA: The pasta was just amazinggggg! Must try. It's not expensive and still better than those of high end cafes or restaurants. The quality is sufficient for two people. 5/5  BURGER: Well, it was unexpected but the burger was also good. The patty was really crunchy and again a burger at this price is worth it! 4/5  MUD CAKE: Liked it, not the best mud cake I've had. 3/5  Going again? Not sure since the cafe didn't have a cool sitting area. :| Ordering the pasta again? Damn yes! :)
Food had less hot and paneer topping added without mixing with other items, raw added. When called to outlet and been informed we do like this and delivery boy came late hence your food became lesser hot. Irresponsible answer from the outlet. U need to make arrangements for foil which other restaurant does.  You can enjoy pizza at outlet then on delivery.  Need improvement from this outlet.
Ordered the Penne arrabbiata (Veg), taste was decently good ,penne was Al Dente. Sauce felt little under cooked and on the name of veggies it was filled with capsicum only (Barely a piece of broccoli). Sauce to pasta ratio was good but was expecting a little more quantity, don't think was good enough for one person meal replacement.

Ms. Soni, such an amazing waitress, sweetest and the most polite service I've got till date from any restaurants I've been to. Food is so tasty and amazing, I am gonna definitely come again. We'd 99 new menu pizza. One garlic bread and one onion cheese pizza. Completely amazing - 10/10 and 11/10 for the waitress.

Quite Simply The Best Pizza I've Ever Eaten After watching the pamphlet and reading all the great reviews, I was delighted to find that Juno's pizza was so close to our apartment. And for the following week, nothing came close to it. The Pizza is incredible. From a week tasting Pizza around ghatkopar, I came back to Junos Pizza on multiple occasions, it was just that good. The ingredients were fresh, the crust was on another level, and the special slices were also fantastic. Whatever you do, make every effort you can to get here. You need to.
This is better place than a roadside chat place ... Dosas are different and good in taste .

Good place ambience was really good i loved this place. Good place to visit . The food taste was really good and quality was amazing Food 4.5/5 Place 4.5/5 Overall 4/5
It's a good place but very small. Not a very good value for money. The pasta wasn't so good. The service was a little slow. Ambience 3/5 Value for food 3/5 Quantity 3/5 Service 3/5 #foodblogger
Mumbai 77 is really amazing it have really good taste of food.... We went there and we found that place good and silent ..... And the dishes was just fabulous
I gave my birthday party to my friends. My friends and me had a good time here. Good food especially pav bhaji fondue. I loved this place. Worth.
I must say, they nailed it. I have been here dozen times and had different from their menu. Never disappointed!  Staff goes extra miles to settle you in. Variety to choose from.
One of tge best place i have been ti a lovely food is served here Try swiss fondue as well as some mind blowing pizzas also some juices and shakes served in different styles
I ordered the cheesy italiano pizza. I was expecting something lip-smacking after reading all the reviews and frankly the pizza was a huge disappointment. Although the quantity, I feel like it was a waste of money. Please work on the quality.
A small place opened in the food capital of Mumbai that is ghatkopar.All vegetarians and Jain food lovers this place is totally ment for you guys. Ambiance is quite simple but pleasing. Staff are really very quick and prompt and suggest you the best dishes to pick up while you are seated there. Coming to the food Amazing quantity and the test of taste in every dish with really amazing presentation skills. Over all a 4/5. Must try are Warped spaghetti balls and dim sums.
Visited this restaurant after watching it on pear app. It is the best app to watch menu in 3D and then order. We Ordered 1. Signature Nachos - 3/5 2. Tandoori Paneer pizza - 4/5 3. Nutella Freakshake 5/5 4. Pav Bhaji Sizzler 2.5/5  However they have this 3D menu which is the best part here. I highly recommend everyone to visit this place with your friends and family as they have the best freakshakes.

Chocolate room has a very tasty deserts that are mouth watering trust me the taste the chocolate the the browines are just as perfect as it has to be . Also the food is good over here pizza , nachos , noodles , fries good in taste too must try it¬† I tried FOOD  1. Peri Peri Fries¬† 2. Schezwan Paneer¬† 3. Chilly Garlic Noodles 4. Tandoori Paneer Pizza¬† 5. Cottage Cheese Garlic Bread  DESERTS  6. Thank God It's Sundae! 7. Choco Kiddyholic Bomb

The worst kitkat shake I have ever had. It was too watery and there was no ice-cream as mentioned in the description. Rates are exorbitant as compared the the quality and quantity. I don't write reviews but this experience has forced me to write one. I feel sorry for this place.

I love the ambience of this place... Very lovely and delighting. The most famous food item served here is Maggi! Indeed a very popular hub for all Maggi lovers...
Perfect Place For Maggi Lovers.  Location:- Near to vidya vihar station.  Ambience:- I really loved their ambience. Simple, Elegant not so fancy.¬†  What we ordered:- 1)Exotic Cheese Magizza:- It was pizza with lots of cheese and Maggi on it.  2) Pizza Sizzler which was tasty and stomach fulfilling.¬†  Service was prompt and the staff was really kind of especially the manager over there.  Overall a great experience. A must-visit place for all maggi lovers.
Black pepper sizzler, lemonade, kiwi tea, Maggie garlic bread was really good.. staff, service n hygeine also good.. Evening time mostly crowded.. But really nice place to chill n enjoy..
This is such a noisy place. Food is also expensive and service is very slow. Tastewise its good for maggie lover. Otherwise its just hyped.
A cozy place to hang out with your budds. Very chirpy, music in the background, and lots and lots of MAGGI everywhere!  So the concept introduced by Hungry Head is ‚ÄòAll about Maggi‚Äô  They have recreated all your favourite dishes with the base of Maggi!  So we tried:  Veggie lover Magizza which is a yum cheesy pizza with veggies. Good to see, delicious to taste! Maggie Sizzler which was by far one of the best sizzlers Mojito is something which is always refreshing, but if it is a Green Apple Mojito, you‚Äôd love it! Also try their Ferrero rocher thick shake!  VFM 4/5 Ambience 4/5 Recommended üëçüèª
Enjoyed the food and the service by guru and Amey was very efficient
as always it has been the best place one could ever visit the food the services provided by amay & guru was amazing will surely visit again
The food is amazing as always Good service by Amey. Thanks. Had a great yime
Amay's service was fabulous... Looking forward in coming back soon and referring to other people too:) Food was great and the Oreo Mud Pot Shake was the thing of the night
Great service by Mr. Ameya at the venue.

A 60+ year old tiffin and coffee place. Worth a visit atleast for its legendary history and legacy . The idli and Kara bath stand out . Coffee is okay. Prices are easy on the pocket . There is no seating area or tables. So one needs to eat standing. Be prepared for it . Don‚Äôt miss this place.
I think the place is over hyped and overrated! Veena stores is better than this joint.  Idli and chutney tastes just OK. Coffee is too watery! One time try as its an iconic place.
Hygiene and quality of food is excellent

This is a very old place. Have been visiting it since childhood. I love the chaat here but it is a little spicy for my pallet. This is like that old Bengaluru style chaat.
""
Diarrhea guaranteed if you have the Bhel Puri here. I doubted it at first, but it has happened to me 3/3 times. My brother says the same thing as well. Never heading there again.
Loved it... truly amazing..the bhel .. obviously is a must try... other dishes like the Masala Puri,sev Puri are very good..it's a must try for all Chaat lovers ..there are 3 branches of the bhel house..chamarajapete is the best one.... overall the experience was very, very good ..the staff are good as the reciprocate well ..
A very old hotel in the centre of Bangalore. It hasn‚Äôt changed much since when it has been established. I have visited this place once. Masala Dose is famous among what they offer, so I recommend trying the dose and also Badam Halwa if you visit this place. It is quite crowded over weekends. You will have to wait for some minutes to snatch a table. One time visit and decent pricing.
Do not judge a book by its cover!!! One of Bengaluru's hidden jewels A must visit place whether its breakfast or lunch. Had their meal which was very tasty, filling and fresh like homemade. Badam halwa is a must try Prompt service, clean n hygenic and reasonable prices ! They even have a bakery next door Worth a visit
"What can be better way then start your day with NMH masala dosa üòã Banguruian knows what NHM means right üòä for non Banguruian it's class '""A"" resturant üëå New Morden Hotel legendary place charm of old banglore speciality is sambar üòãüòã Excellent place to try south indian dishes‚úîÔ∏è Ghee bread toast is also must try dish served with pineapple sauceüíØ"
One of the older establishments for breakfast in Bengaluru. Humble and honest place if you want some fresh food and tasty food. The upit was very tasty and vada was good too. Sabar was nice. Fresh food. Quick service and good staff too.

Food that calms the soul on any day. Fishland is one of the finest restaurants not only for the seafood but also for vegetarian delicacies.  The Crab chilli boneless( yes! BONELESS ) is to die for. The Chicken 65 leaves you wanting for more. Fishland transports you to sandy beaches and western ghats just with their food.
Eventhough being a localite I'm giving a honest review and rating since the localities just blindly love this place only because it brings nostalgia to them of this decades old restaurant when there were not much options for good seafood in bangalore. I ordered the full fish thali and I really liked the taste and quality they have maintained but unfortunately coz of growth I've had better fish thalis with more variety in this price in bangalore. But il still recommend this place just for originality they have maintained of the interiors and taste.
This outlet of Chikkanna Tiffin Room is located in City Market in Dharmaraya Swamy temple road. This is one of the oldest Dosa points in around Bangalore still existing.  Best place to hang out for Dose lovers. Chikkanna Tiffin Room have options like Rice Bath, Dosa and Idly items. I have tried Mini Benne Masla Dosa, Coffee, Uddina Vada, Idly here and the taste of the Dosa is very authentic to Chikkanna, it was crispy and it is served with a combination of Gatty Chutney, Tomato Chutney and one can expect Uddina Vada is too soft and crispy enough to eat.¬†  Overall,   Food- 4.5/5 Service - 4/5 Ambience - 3/5 Value for money - 3.5/5 Overall Rating - 4

One of the best places for breakfast. No wonder it has great reviews on zomato. Ghee pudi idly, kaali dose and pudi masala dose are a must try.  Rating:  Ambience : 2/5 Taste : 5/5 Value for money : 4/5
""
""
Good but not the best. Although the place is in a crowded locality, there is a lot of space inside. Coming to the food, the usp was supposed to be the ghee and the dosa. Although the dosas tasted good, the aroma of the ghee was a bit lacking. The only thing I liked was the chutney-thick, spicy. One of the best chutneys I have tasted.
""
Lakshmi Natraja Refreshments is the place where I love to vist often when I'm there in Chikpet for shopping. Place is really small & very limited seats to occupy.  Lakshmi Natraja Refreshments serves authentic South Indian dishes like South Indian Breakfast, Lunch & South Indian Tiffin Dishes.  I highly recommend here to have Idli, Pudi Masala Dosa & Onion Utthapa if you are there for Breakfast & Dinner. Management have recently introduced Kerala Parotta. 2 pieces of Parotta served with Chana Masala & Coconut Chutney.  Lakshmi Natraja Refreshments is also known for their South Indian Meals which they serve only for lunch hours. I have never tried their Meals, planning to taste those too.  Overall When you are around Chikpet & Market area for shopping, if you are in search of good food, Lakshmi Natraja Refreshments is the best option to choose.
A hidden gem for dosas in Majestic area. One needs gmaps to find this place. Walking is the best option.They are known for their podi dosas. The place is clean and we enjoyed the dosa as well. Must visit if you are in and around Majestic
They have the best idly in town. Idly are soft as cotton and crispy dosa. They have a variety of other things which are good i.e podi idly, podi dosa, chitranna (lemon rice)
SOUTH INDIAN MEALS
Visited for lunch. Right next to Sapna book house. Menu said rice items are available till 4 PM but at 2.45 PM we were told Bisibele bath, puliyogre and other rice items are not available. Had to order meals instead, spending 25 Rs more. Meals was good. Extra rice was given when we didn't want poori. Overall nice and reasonably priced place for good south Indian food.
Okay place. But it‚Äôs one of the good place to eat in majestic area. Service is okay. They have both self service and service. One time you can visit this place.
Had been here. Manager is arrogant and the taste of food is pathetic. I really don't recommend it to anyone else. It's not at all worthy....
We¬†planeed wedding event here and exactly at 10 PM they shutdown the music system and also was very rude stating that they do not allow music after 10pm. Not good if you want to plan an event. Very unprofessional manager.
Quality has definitely dropped! Their dosa's are not as good as they used to be. However bisi bele bath is the besttt ! Rasmalai was surprisingly very good too!

We went here on a working morning, and the place was still pretty crowded. We had two masala dosas, a tea and a coffee, and our total bill was 260‚Çπ. The dosas were delicious, however with time, the portion Sizes at MTR have reduced while the prices have increased.
MTR has many outlets around the city, but this outlet is located in the heart of the city, near Majestic Bus Stand.Its an iconic restaurant serving the classic south indian recipes.I ordered filtered coffee and a rava masala dosa, the dosa was the best I‚Äôve ever had, served with thick sambhar and green coconut chutney, it just melted in my mouth.The best place to come with your friends and to chit chat over a cup of coffee.

Had been here for a birthday dinner. Staff were quite courteous .overall place was filled with people who were staying in the hotel , probably we were the only ones n who have come for dining. Food was average nothing great ,nor extraordinary .
I heart this place. Absolute stunner. There's such a great buffet spread and the best part is I went on a Halloween night - the theme was all spooky. The desserts were sweetly scary ü¶á The food was named ensuring there's a spooky touch to it. The choices are ample and the quality of food is fantastic. Some of my absolute favorites were the sea food soup, fish tikka, biryani, momos and yes ofcourse all of the desserts. The team was always on their feet to ensure you have a good time. The location is a little too far and it takes almost the same time it would to reach the airport but it's worth a drive given the beautiful Bangalore weather and great food that awaits. I surely had a time of my life.
A Beautiful Space for Dining with very interesting Menu.. We had been there for Family Dinner.. A Huge Buffet option with wide & varieties of Spread, everything from Starters to Dessert was wonderful.. Live counters for Pasta, Noodles & Dosa was extremely good serving hot stuff right on our plate.. They even had Chats Counter with mouth watering chats.Starters had Chilly Chicken, Amritsar Fish Fry, Potato Wedges with Mint Masala Chutney tasted too good.. Main Course had lot of options but we chose Butter Naan with Butter Chicken,Mutton Biryani was classic. Dessert had too many option of Pasteries, Choices Of Ice Creams with too many options of toppings on it. Over All A Wonderful Choice for Dining
I got the 50% off on buffet deal during GIRF. The breakfast spread was vast and amazing. Every dish was well crafted and presented well. The donuts, cupcakes, 5 different cheese varities, fress dosa, omletes...everything was worth. Thank you for the wonderful service.
I have ordered chicken Hakka noodles from Wokchow.The noodle taste was ok,not so great and the sauce they have given was average.Overall I can give 3 rating.... it‚Äôs average taste.

We ordered shanghai chicken and garlic chicken but what we received was the same thing, just in two different packages. A lot of food color was added that the stain still remained even after washing. The taste was really bland and had a lot of oil content. Will never recommend.

Very quiet Italian dining place. They usually have very soft music playing in the background with a very limited niche menu to choose from. Slightly expensive but the food is good.

Upscale Italian  Very aesthetically designed interiors, with classic furniture and perfect lighting. The menu offers a good selection of salads, pastas and wines. Please do check for availability of all salads before you start craving the taste of the specific cheese or veggie. You are given a free hand to mix n match pasta and the sauce. Risottos are worth mentioning too. I have never tried their deserts though.
Lovely ambience , it has got classic Italian feel . The choice of wine is good . Servers are pleasant . Food is above average and they have good choice of dishes .
We celebrated my son's birthday with a family dinner at mezzaluna. Excellent dining experience with a nice Italian ambiance of Tuscany. We started the evening with chef Gaurav suggesting some garlic bread, salad pizza and soup for starters. Found some unique and tasty mocktails like the pan flavored 'Pan pasand' and the spicy 'Herbilicious'.  We tried a variety of pastas from pumpkin fund ravioli to gnocchi and spaghetti each with an exquisite sauce. The desserts were a highlight with the tiramisu filled eclair leading the pack, closely followed by the smoke flavoured afagato with a nice ring of espresso and the panacotta. The the layered chocolate cake to celebrate my son's birthday just about rounded up a wonderful dining experience for the family.
We decided to visit this on a weekday. The restaurant was empty. Ambience was good. Food was ok and needs to improve. People looking for pure vegetarian options can consider going here .
Amazing place for punjabi food lovers. The food quality and taste is top notch. Every dish available here is mouth watering and you just cant stop from ordeing the paneer and mushroom starters. The management here is humble and plesant. This restaurant is customet centric for which i take my frienda and family for outings as the restaurant has no compromise on quality and taste and thats what i get to hear from my friends which makes me glad too. 5/5 for this place.
Decided to visit this place for lunch with friends for a proper north Indian food. This restaurant was empty on Friday afternoon and we were the only ones there. We ordered Gobhu Manchurian, American corn in starters and they were good and even soups were ok (manchow, tomato and sweet corn)... In main course we ordered dal makhani, paneer kali mirch and lasooni veg all of which tasted good and were served with enough quantity. I would have given it a 4, but then came the issue which is: We ordered lemon soda which was not listed in Menu and when Bill came price for lemon soda was way more than normal pricing here and even higher than a lassi or badam milk or anything and everything.. Which was surprising.. And short of a fraud with customer. No change a normal lemon soda can cost more than all the beverages n desserts in menu.  Will not recommend this place.

This place is difficult to locate if you are not familiar it‚Äôs this area. They also have a few car parking and this is a rooftop restaurant. We were impressed with the lighting and seating as soon as we entered. We had tomato soup, paneer Biriyani and dal makhani. We really enjoyed the food here. Must visit place.
Ordered for a delivery today , satisfied with food I received Quantity of veg biryani was enough for two and paneer 65 was tasty as well Keep up good work
Worst experience ever! There wre rats going around, and the waiter was least bothered! We ordered butter roti ,they gave us ‚Äòghee roti‚Äô! Very unhygienic!
Love their Biriyani!! Great taste and great quality and quantity. Prompt delivery as well. The kebabs are very well done as well. This has become my all time favourite restaurant for biriyani now.
Worst delivery experience , I will not order from here again , and delivery boy also not showing any respect the late order, I m really disappointed
This place is best for it's shawarmas!! Also the mutton biriyani is very tasty especially you should try double masala if you like spicy food! The quantity is great for the price! A place definitely to go for Indian food.

Order egg with chicken took some 30 min to deliver but that time it is cool.it was Ok OK type. packing was worst.... No restaurant will pack like this
One of the best outlet Kolkata Famous Kati Rolls have and most important the spicy panner roll you get here is üî•.its so spicy literally you can feel your taste buds enjoying every bit of itüòç
ordered three rolls but they delivered only two rolls
The best tandoori chicken I have ever had. Literally so soft and juicy. Normally tandoori chicken is so dry elsewhere. My only complaint is the packing part. The food was just covered with silver foil that too it was coming out. The food can be easily tampered. Come on you have nearly taken 50 rupees extra charges, you can send the food in tamper proof or sealed container. The taste saved your day as careless packaging would have taken away 2 points out of five. Please improve on packing.
Very bad, no taste, no quality, disappointed. Not recommended at all. Very bad. Poor quality and not tasty. Don‚Äôt go for this restaurant. Worst experience
wrong item
good food and delivery on time

Probably the worst place I've ever been to. The waiters are not clear about how the billing system works. The service was adequate though not great. I would suggest you to consider other places before coming to this place. Quite disappointed.
This place is awesome!!! Food was excellent except for fish n chips.  Summer mule mocktail was awesome must try !!! Animesh was a excellent in providing us good service and recommendations  Only draw back was the pricy menu but worth it.
Nice plush setup with pool table, big screen projector. We came for a dinner visit and thought of some beers which ended up here.  Polite service, good ambience. All in all, okay type place. If you're in the same vicinity then this place could be an option to spend some peaceful time enjoying your drink.
I had been to this place few months back when the Hotel was known as M√∂venpick. The service was amazing. All credits to Tony who was best at what he does.
Poor service! They call it a sports bar and I have to remind them to put the INDIA cricket game which they don't have any idea about. No one looks interested in even serving customers. Really the most crap bar I've visited!
Egg not fried worst fried rice
This is like one of my most favourite places to have food from. Be it quality, quantity, or price, they have never failed to disappoint me. Chilly potato is something that I drool over the most. Also, the delivery time taken is also less. I would highly recommend this place as it is very much pocket-friendly and also you get good food at a low rate. Cheers!!
This is located in the bel main road..I have orderd palak kichdi but I didnt get what I orderd taste was also not up to the mark.. tandoori kabab taste was ok ok.. but this place is good for only tea and starters
Visited the place for coffee and midday snacks. Coffee and Tea were average, unfortunately not much options were available for midday snacks. One may visit the place for a quick or rather emergency bite if hunger strikes. Definitely not a fine dining place.
One of the worst food.. they delivered the stale food which was smelling like hell...Please never ever order from this restaurant. Save your money or better eat Street food as they are far better from this restaurant...
Good restaurant very fast service Awesome Staffs many choices of food...karama

The best place to chill out and have fun
The ambience is good.  Veg burger is good. Chocolate shake wasn‚Äôt thick how it should be. Chicken burger wasn‚Äôt worth 215 Rs.  The waiter was really uninterested. We asked him to click a picture, he appeared so irritated. The overall experience is nice.  Just for the overall vibe I gave 4 rating.
I like how in the coldest december this place has a certain warmth about it. It must be love!
Home Delivery. Trucker Burger. Not a single packet of sauce along with the burger. Disgusting. They do not keep up to their word on the menu. Please consider another option for home delivery unless you a fan.
Well done interiors and super views. Food is also very well priced. The only drawback is that they do not have a separate smoking¬† zone which gives non smokers a pretty tough time
Delicious food, excellent service. Special Kudos to Bilas. Extremely courteous. Will continue visiting for years to come
Tanks bilas for such a services
Food was great .. good non veg starters ... Bilas was amazing...

yeah !the place is called mangalore pearl and is located at small place in frazer town.  I personally love the ambiance of the place and the little tables and L shaped interior. in the place. the carricatuted graffiti walls that are there themed around the coastal lifestyle it really beautiful. This place can get super crowded on peak hours. Have been here twice so far and my experience has been good. The staff here are well mannered. This about a few things I have relished here in my visits. tomato soup - servrd warm anf tasted good. veg sukka with sannas. Sannas were soft and tasted good. it was fluffy. Veg sukka a green masala based curry made with cocunut abd vegetables made a perfect accompaniment for sanna and neer dosa. white pomfret masala- fried pomfret in thick masala - that had a slight hint of kokum. lovd it. The fish used was a fresh catch and is cleaned well. neer dosa was moist enough a little smaller on size. and was perfectly thin . kaane ambot this curry - medley of tangy anf spicy curry. that took me down the memory lanes of my days in mangalore. this will go well with boiled rice or kori rotti or sannas. ragi manni is yet another favourite of mine on this place.

Serves up some delightful Mangalorean fare. The chicken ghee roast and the roast pork were full of flavour and the soft Neer Dosas and Sannas complemented it perfectly. Will be looking to try the seafood next time. Decent on all other counts be it ambiance, service or the cost.  Bon App√©tit
Best place for a sea food lover , good place for a family lunch or dinner, yummiest sea food ever tasted and i loved neer dosa and prawn ghee roast, it just made my day , it's just finger licking good , it's yummy yummy

Visited skoolroom cafe long back with a friend. It‚Äôs a trip down memory lane when you visit.... you are reminded of school days seeing all the equations and formulas on the walls, school box for pens which actually has cutlery and also chemistry lab theme flasks. Everything is so detailed here    Since both my friend and I love pizza and pasta we ordered paneer and mushroom pizza and twisted Mac and cheese pasta. Both were really delicious. Pizza had lots of of toppings and was flavourful.   Peach ice tea was very bitter though.... service was bit slow   Give this place a go....
Recently, I visited this awesome, beautiful and nostalgic restaurant. Why I am saying it nostalgic because of its ambience and decor. Talking about the Interior of this place they have tried to give a school classroom look with every possible way. And they have succeeded in their attempt. From the chairs, tables to wall arts everything will resemble you of your school days. They also serve the spoons in a pencil box, also their menu is like the notebook and the bill payment card is like the report card that you guys use to get after your exams. Now let's talk about the food here I did try their burgers, pizza and Maggi. I order their chicken pizza, chicken tikka burger and chicken pizza. Everything was delicious and superb, to be honest, I like the flavour. And I highly recommend you guys to try out their white rice and Thai chicken curry combo especially. So, overall I love the place for everything I experienced there. A must visit place if you love to have some delicious meals with your friends and kids.
Food was served hot and tasty but not sending sauce along with the momos even after charging higher compared to others was a let down
I don't even want to give 1 star for the biryani that was delivered yesterday. The food was charred and rice remaining at bottom of the vessel has been given. I have ordered food from Rahhams many times but yesterday I had a worst experience, will never order again from Rahhams.

Dey r making fool out of people.. dey hv increased d price of items... infact dey r cheating... n many of d items r always sold out on uber eats but available on zomato wit high pricing.. plz dont fool people.. taste not worth.. DEAGH restaurant is really far better in pricing and taste wise..
Never online order from here. No idea why the order gets cancelled at the last moment after all the wait. This has happened twice with this place.

Amazing place
Must try tender beef steak with mushroom sauce. The ambiance is very good and service is also prompt. I will definitely love visit again.
"I'll keep this review short, I'm writing this after I've been to Millers around 3 times over the last 2 years. Yes, it's the most famous steakhouse in Bangalore, and yes its for CHICKEN WINGS!! Not their steaks. I've had a lot of varieties of steaks here and they have been consistently cooking them badly. Millers steaks now have a reputation for being ""undercooked"" or ""tough"". If people are having bad steaks and calling them delicious, you should try Connie's steakhouse. This review is basically just for their spicy chicken wings, the music, the best pork ribs in town and damn they make a mean mango cheesecake!"
""
Loved their steak. The best juiciest chicken i have ever had. The gravy is simply yum!!
""
Very nice pure Vegetarian Hotel.Service was good but pricing is very high. Seating is ok. Taste is delicious. We ordered directly maincourse. Tandoori roti,Plain kulcha and Butter Kulcha it was really soft and not over roasted..perfect for us. The Paneer Masala gravy was finger licking. A delicious onion and tomato based gravy with very fresh and soft Paneer along diced onion tomato and capsicum with perfectly blended spices.  Will visit again for more delicasies.
Awesome place We had lunch today here the kulcha's we're just amazing would like to visit once again to try the starters, the panner gravy was also too too Good Felt a bit expensive but for the quality or quantity they provide it's worth the price My Rating 5*out of 5*
A very nice place for vegetarians to try out a variety of fusions of food. Ambience is really great. Staffs are at their best service. Nice place to hang out.
Ambience: Good, got a good retro fit like ambience, got enough space to accommodate any group size. Lighting and music adds to the charm. Food: Good, must try appetisers, pucka shots were not all that great. bread cheese roll, and spaghetti cheese balls were yummy. Service: OK, slow, staff arrogant, doesn't give by two service, Price: High, can go only once for the food or not finding place elsewhere. Else you can lookout for any other option Overall : 3 stars
One of the best Places in Sheshadripuram,we ordered alot of Items in Which Poochka Shots wer Amazing,Paneer Bhurji was at its best,Pav Bhaji was Sober,they serve amazing Own Made Pavs which is Cherry on the Cake,Need to improve alot on Italian(Pasta),the Plating was superbly done,Coming to the Beverage Aam Panna was Heart Touching,Kala Khatta Gola reminds the Shore of Juhu Beach,last but Not least Gulab Jamoon Cheese Cake was Confusing- Liked the taste but dint understand the concept of it,,their was no cake but full of Ice Cream,,keeping everything aside one must definitely Visit.. Coming on Pricing-Its Reasonable according to the Quantity & Location.. Service- Service is little Slow,I believe they can definitely work on service..
The place where seafood rocks - sea rock Everytime I passed by kn the streets of Sheshadripuram there was one thing that I mostly felt missing was a lunch or dinner at The searock. But wish came true when I went to have my lunch with family in this place last Saturday. Old school type ambiance with comfortable seating. Luckily the place did not smell fishy. Though this is a place that has been hee quiet a while they have maintained the cleanliness which is something that i appreciate. Coming to food we were a group of 8 people that were a mix of vegetarians and non vegetarian for good pf choice. here is what we all had here: Anjal tawa fry - naked sear fish tawa fry. This one was mildly spiced and slightly tangy. Pomfret masala fry - deep fried white pomfret fish served with a layer of moist masala. This can be relished as a starter alongside a drink or this pais will with neer dosa or pundi. I relished the whole of this on its own. Marwai sukka - a quite popular coastal delicacy made using clams. A good dose of dry coconut used in the preparation enhanced the taste. Kaane rawa fry - a classic rawa fry using kaane fish - the fish is vooked well. Not very oily. loved the crispy coat of rawa and tastebof masala. Took me back to my college bdays in Mangalore. Prawn ghee roast - yet another coastal delicacy prepared busing fresh prawns that are cleanrd well. The masala had the right amount of spices and had a good generous dose of ghee. egg ghee roast - classic coastal ghee roasy made using boiled eggs. had a generous coat of masala over the boiled eggs. A vegetarian variant of ghee roast for the Vegetarian patrons were mushroom ghee roast and paneer ghee - the taste was not compromised - was in par with the non veg varaints in taste and texture. The are the things we had for mains: kotte kadubu - a dish that is made with rice rawa based batter that is steam cooked in cup made of leaves which is called kotte in local language - which gives it a name as kotte kadubu. loved the texture - this paired well with drumstick curry and bangada fish curry. neer dosa - was super thin - but was a bit dry - could have been a bit moist. but the thin layer was a marvel. Ragi manni - this is one other classic coastal dessert which should not be missed in this place. All in all searock is one place where the sea food rocks with classic coastal taste. The highlight in this place is the fresh catch that goes into fish preparation.
After so many failed plans to go here, finally made my visit to the Bengaluru's one of the oldest, coastal food restaurant located in the centre of the city, just at the corner of Shivanand circle.  Started off with a strong masala filled buttermilk,I guess the best way to start one's meal on a heavy humid day.  To tell about this place, they serves basically the Mangalorean coastal food which again takes route of authentic Shetty style, so everything you can expect is the rich masala stuffed, flavoursome coastal delicacies.  Tried so many sea food starters here like prawns ghee roast, mussels fry, squid, kane fry, fish pulimunchi, crabs n some other. To sum all, every dish here is a masterclass prepared by chef's who has a period of 20+ years experience.  Every starter was equally delicious giving the hint of slight coconut oil. And if any vegetarians thinking that this is not a spot for you, you are mistaken my friend, this place really serves hell delicious vegetarian food which I was spellbounded as soon as I tasted. To mention some they have some amazing Starters , to be explicit try there mushroom ghee roast I bet you won't stop for one plate. Indeed a beauty it is.  To give a hiatus before getting into the main course I had there special sea food soup , OMG! Never tasted any mix of prawns n fish with a generous amount of coconut milk n some spices this soup was prepared to perfection.  In main course I tried their kotte kadubu, neer dose, with chicken curry n nuggekayi saaru. The best ever combination it was. The nuggekayi saaru was so good that you can feel that essence as soon as you take a bite.  To the end comes the real Gamer SEA ROCKS SPECIAL PALAK RICE , I was unaware that palak rice can be so tasty as it is here. The prominent flavour of palak hitting the senses makes you drool more. Must try when you are here.  To end a hearty meal we got our hands on the Ragi manni, nothing but a Panna cotta.  To conclude, sea Rock is place for all the food lovers especially the sea food lovers.

We all friends are regular in Eden Park as it's close by to our place. We never had an issue in one year but yesterday when the whole group went the manager who took our order Me Sanjeev was a horrible person to talk to . He cheated completely on the bill thinking it was all girls and fooled us . Arrogance was the name for that person .the hotel should do something about the staff .
The ambience is just okay and the food isn't worth the price and hukkah was horrible. We had Bamboo chicken biryani after hearing all the hype, but it was disappointing. Would not come again.
""
The interiors are truly with outdoor seating.¬† However the food and service was a sore disappointment....Steep price to pay for a much awaited experience based on all the positive reviews...Will never recommend...

"Visited this place for dinner last night. This was my first luxury dining experience with my wife, and I am not disappointed with the time I had spent at restaurant.  It is located on 18th floor, there are two options to sit: one outside which has fantastic city view and other one inside. I would recommend anyone to take city view place if weather is good. Reached early to restaurant, the ground staff guided us to the restaurant place. We are the first customers to enter the place, so we had the option to choose our seat.  Menus offered to us:  1. Ala carte  2. Kabab special which was around Rs.1699+tax. Here they will serve different types of unlimited kababs with romali roti, rice and end with sweet.  3. Set Menu costed around Rs.2500+tax. I felt this bit costly. We had opted for Veg Set Menu:  ‚Ä¢	Started with hot tomato shorba.  ‚Ä¢	Next starters, they give 3 starters (one piece each), starters were really good and i was expecting at least 2 pieces of each starter :). The starters are limited.  ‚Ä¢	In main course there were 3 curries and 3 different types of roti‚Äôs, curries were just awesome, and roti‚Äôs are served hot. Next was hot veg biryani, it was just amazing and good mix of spices. Main course is unlimited.  ‚Ä¢	At the end, they serve desserts, one gulab jamoon and one scoop of ice cream. Both are good.  Some more points:  1. Ambience is just awesome. Candle light dinner place.  2. Very good service and helpful staff.  3. Food is tasty and good quality.  4. I felt it was bit costly when it comes to set menu.  5. There was private party on 19th floor, hence it was noisy.  Overall a good experience, I recommend this restaurant to others if they don‚Äôt have price tag on their minds."
Ssaffron is an excellent place if you‚Äôd like to have a relaxed dinner. The service could be a bit quicker, but the staff are very courteous and the food is delicious.
first thing, i want to say that the ambience is so lovely , the taste was something like out of the world, we tried zaraja parantha, kumbh ki gilawat ,dal saffron,in cocktail we tried gimlet, we went for the our anniversary. Very impressed.
""
The food was ordered through Zomato Delivery, and the Mexican Rice and sauce provided to me was stale. When I spoke to the restaurant manager and the chef, he did not believe it and disconnected the call.
Nice taste.
Must try paneer chilly, corn cheese balls, paneer makhani Biriyani, choco lava cake and kit kat milkshake here
Another destination for sheesha lovers. Place is always crowded no matter if it's a day or night. I was there for a lunch on a weekday. Ordered tomato soup, garden salad, pav bhaji and ceasar salad. Service took longer than usual. I had to ask again and again for my food and at the end I did request to cancel pav bhaji in case it was not done as I had to go back to office and resume work. It has a decent ambience nothing exceptional to add. Food was delicious and that was a plus. Staff was polite. It was an overall good experience at the end.
""
It had the exact amount of spice and sweetness. Loved the taste and also it was hot when it was delivered.
Very disappointed with the service and taste provided. Had ordered malai kofta and veg pulao. Rates are on higher side considering the taste and quantity they provide. Not going there again.
The best place to order from in Kaggadasapura üòÑ if you want to eat Indian food. I have two particular dish combi to recommend.  1 - Paneer Tikka Masala with Garlic Butter Naan 2 - Schezwan noodles with Honey Chilly Potato.  It is a bit expensive place but then if you want a happee belly instead of hungree one, this is it.
are you a fan of desi chicken???  Do you want to try the desi taste in denner meal? Well you need to scoop in your taste buds right here and try the most amazing variety of chicken.  I ordered kadhai chicken and phulkas!! I assure the super amazing taste of it to you! I loved it, and i am sure u will also love it.
Jasmuddin the delivery boy from domino was very polite and he delivered the pizza before 30 mins...

Pizza Delivery in 30 min applied however it got delivered in 90 mins.Now a days it happen most of the time and Domino is least bother to fix it.

Do not, by any chance, order from this location. Your order will take forever to reach and moreover zomato doesn't deal with dominos orders. So you will not get refund also. So money will be gone and food also will not be delivered.
The pizzas are really good ... Good amount of chicken on top of pizzas .. verry tasty ü§©... Mojo pizzas are so different from other pizzas
""
Ordered choco lava cake and had it after 15mins. To my surprise it turned into liquid, never had this issue with the same ordered from Dominos! Will not order this item again from here
They took one and half hour to deliver. . Then order has to be cancelled
They usually deliver some amazing pizzzas, I dont know what goes wrong only when I order. I Ordered using their app. Ordered for a crowded house pizza. Firstly, the pizza was almost cold before it was delivered to my place even though I hardly live a km away from the outlet. Secondly, Crowded house pizza as the name and description suggested had nothing like extra cheese or even toppings on it. The is the first time I experienced something like this with him when it came to toppings. The toppings were extremely less this time. Third, the pizza was over done at several places on the crusts and on the base as well. Awful experience!
Lasuni murg tikka is must try. The biryani‚Äôs are good but quantity is on lesser side. Spice level is ok, you can customise it. Space is little if you are planning to throw a party. Recommend to call the hotel directly for offers. If you stay nearby, the delivery is super quick.
I ordered paneer butter masala and egg fried rice. Eg fried rice was ok not very tasty. Paneer gravy was too spicy very thick red colour and bad paneer taste. I have paneer gravy from matka house before, it never use to be such bad as this time. They should maintain some standards to make customer visit again and again.
Worst Biriyani ever had. Big NO if you want to try Biriyani. It was fried rice with only bones. I called them up and they were unapologetic even with the terrible food they served. They seriously need a UTube tutorial on how to serve Biriyani. I can write a lot more but forget it.........
Matka house serves delicious Punjabi food in kaggadasapura area . All of their veg curries have authentic Punjabi taste, though sometimes they put a little too much salt/sugar in their curries.  We booked them for catering service our new year dinner party and it was liked by most people. They have open dining place.
Food ordered from this place was really tasty. i liked paneer 65 and prawn do pyaza. They delivered our parcel on time and our guests also liked it.
Great quality biriyani ...¬† I tried chicken and egg biriyani many times and whenever possible I order from there. Great taste. Biriyani lovers must try.
This restaurant has become a landmark for its location in Vignan Nagar and about food, may not add a wow factor when you have similar restaurant formats stone throw away. Drop by if you love grilled Chicken. Say no to Biriyani, as this is not a specialty restaurant.
on time delivery  zomato is an great food appüëçüëç
Had ordered Al Fahm chicken from this place. The food was uncooked and absolutely tasteless. I called up the restaurant and shared the feed back, the guy was trying to lecture me that Al Fahm is supposed to be half cooked. If you ever think about ordering anything from this place please avoid Al Fahm.
Tasty food and in more cheapest price. Fastest way of order accepting and quick delivery.user friendly restaurant.i wish to include sea foods also
""
Worst food. I have ordered hony chilli potato and crispy corn. Both test was horrible and not prepared properly. Worst shop. Never going to order from this shop.
Please don't order from this hotel
Horrible food ...definitely not ordering again
i ordered triple chicken fried rice or veg ball Manchurian and there was only 4 piece of chicken ... And taste was worst ... Please don't order from Hong Kong garden
""
Salty Gobi Manchurian, Forgot to give me Laacha Paratha and Chicken Tikka - When asked they said sorry and disconnected the call. Butter garlic naan had no butter and entire chunk of Garlic. Most disgusting and tasteless Butter chicken, had some daal and 2 pieces of chicken. Panner Paratha had no panner and was burnt. Do not order from this place because you are just wasting your time, money and will be only left annoyed and Hungry!!
Packaging charges for each chapati is 5rs. But they deliver all chapati in same packet.Then what does it make sense for paying packaging charges for chapati separately when i am getting all chapati in single packet.. They are simply cheating people ___________________________________________ For example 5 chapati ==> 50rs + 25rs for packaging charges 6 chapati ==> 60rs + 30rs for packaging charges ___________________ But they pack all chapati in same packet..
I am coming from Punjab so I will 1st time order for Punjab junction so food is very tasty so I am very satisfied so My all food lovers order this restaurant
""
Love the shawarma here ... Nice and juicy üíì
I received stale food. The chicken curry was smelling stale and when I tasted it I was pretty sure it was stale. They had used leftovers from previous day's gravy and curry. Extremely disappointed. üò†üò†üò† Moreover kebab that I received was absolutely burnt. You can understand what quality of food I received. I would never ever opt for this place again ü§Æ üòì
""
Excellent environment, friendly service, great menu choices and really decent food and at affordable prices. Will be back.
Worst ever experience. Food delivered to table but there was no plates provided, no water given, partial food was delivered and after sometime they came and said item not available, long wait time between starter and main course. Food taste was worst. And finally paid huge:(

Reviewed it as part of Box8 Review Program.  Food- Chicken Tikka Biryani was delivered hot. The ratio of Masala to Rice was perfect. Basmati Rice was used and it was not too spicy.  The Chicken in biryani was however not tasty. It lacked flavour. Chicken Kebab along with it was tender and tasty.  Gulab Jamuns were average. It was softer than normal and bland. The sugar syrup balanced it but not well.  Choco Lava was yum. It was delivered hot with molten chocolate in the center. It was not to sweet.  Masala Lemonade though a simple drink was worth mentioning. It was chilled and absolutely refreshing with good amount of Masala striking a perfect balance between spicy and sweet.  Service- Quick and prompt  Rating- 4 as some items need improvement in taste.
Pathetic ...got hair inside the rajma...such poor control of personal hygiene and food safety! So sad!!!
Earlier the qty use to be average...this time the qty is ...as if I have ordered desserts...poor show box8
KINDLY REDUCE THE PACKAGING WASTE YOU ARE CREATING BY PUTTING 1-2 ROTIS IN DIFFERENT-DIFFERENT BIXES.
Food is just not that good,i dont know what they used for making the nuggets and the chocolate shake was not good either.......,............
We spend almost every weekend lazing at this cafe in the evening!  Such a quaint, beautiful hole-in-the-wall cafe near Reva University - this cafe makes everything, all breads, etc, in-house. The taste is amazing, prices are low and the quantities are massive.  The interiors are well-done, least to say, and we get the perfect golden hour light in here. Also, great music collection!  Must visit with the perfect sorta' ambience.
The best cafe in India, please try it and you won't regret it. The staffs are very friendly and helpful, the food is excellent and the music is on point.
Ambiance is fine and place is pocket friendly. They have a wide variety of Burgers, Sandwiches and Subs which they serve really well. Their Milkshakes and Juices is really good considering the prices. Specially Chocolate Shake, Oreo Shake & Big Boy Sandwich. A good place for college students to bunk and hangoutüòÇ
"This place is located near the BSF circle and is one of the most favorite hangout places for REVA University students. It's a small place and is nicely decorated with all those brick walls and a dozen novels, it's perfectly lit up and the music is quite loud as opposed to what we generally expect from a cafe. It's not exactly a cafe, per se.  The ambiance is decent I would say, nothing too fancy  I've tasted almost everything on their menu. Everything is good. I wouldn't say the best, but yes better than most of the joints serving similar food. My most favorite has to be the California Veg wrap. It's delicious and perfectly made. And yes, they also give out free fries with every dish which is a bonus! I wouldn't recommend you try their beverages which I feel is on the expensive side. But the beverage which is a must try is the ""Fresh lime"" juice. Nothing fancy about this. It just costs Rs. 20. And it's refreshing.   The staff here is extremely friendly. I absolutely like their service.  It is fast. The price is also very affordable.¬†  So if you're around Reva and want to have some good food (burgers, sandwiches, wraps, and quesadillas ) then surely visit here.   My ratings would be:  Food: 3.5/5  Ambiance: 3.5/5  Staff: 4.5/5"
Been here many times. Pretty close to my location. It's definitely high priced on most items. However, their dosas are really tasty. Would recommend to try their neer dosa. Don't go for their coffee much, it's cheap but not good. Oh, and in the afternoon, they serve dahi vada. They do prepare it in near perfection. I mostly go there nowadays for dahi vada only.
Very poor ambience.. Very late food delivery. No cleanliness. Staff is not polite also.. They don't bother about customer complaints . And food is very average taste and not fresh
Great Dosa, Idlies and coffee you get here. When crowded, service is slow. Cleanliness is maintained well also around the restaurant. Parking is an issue here as it‚Äôs on the main road.
Did a very big mistake, even after reading so many bad reviews about this place both in ZOMATO and GOOGLE. Yes, in both the reviews are really bad.  But still wanted to go out and wanted try myself. Being a foodie.  Their menu has plethora of items but none will be available. yes you read it correct. They show millet idli and dosas but they never available. they have a special healthy menu but nothing is available in that menu.  They have 2 sections, ground floor is darshini kind of hotel. first floor is with seating arrangements. For breakfast, went to first floor with seating arrangement. As it was weekend, place is full and crowded.  for all those 7 to 10 tables with around 20 people on the floor only one server. so imagine the situation of the customers. who are seated patiently waiting for their turn to come.  Finally they came to take the order and to our surprise most of the items are not available. what being weekend and that in a place like Yelahanka where there are much options to eat out. this place is even getting worst.  Ok finally i managed to give the order and ordered only idli. vada, masala dosa and neer dosa.  And Idli and dosas came after loooooong wait. nothing was hot, not even idli was served hot. so even dosas. Taste is ok ok. there is nothing much to tell about dosas, there is not even a inch of difference between masala dosa and neer dosa. both were same.  Completely avoid going to service section as service is horribly slow. if you still want to go and try you can go to darshini style which is on ground floor.  And the prices are too much, there is no match with the quality and quantity and the price they charge.  This place is just opposite of Yelahanka new town bustop, so watch out for parking. road side parking only.  Overall a highly expected breakfast gone completely wrong on a weekend. Completely avoidable.  Scores:  Ambience: 2/5 Food: 2/5 Service: 1/5 Value for money: 1/5  Overall: 1/5
Tasty food, close to my place, nice ambience, courtesy staff. The only problem is with service. They take lot of time while serve the food. Lot of variety on the menu.

Best place to visit
Walked in for breakfast and it was a poor we experience overall. It's self-service and the cashier is not very happy to help. I asked a couple of questions regarding the eggs and the guy tries to shoos me away to an apparent full fledged menu stuck on the way. I tried ordering some toast and was told I have to wait as they started the day by forgetting to bring in the bread. The egg combos looked interesting but the aerated drink cannot be replaced for a coffee. So it was a no option morning at a place that had the potential to scale and be impressive.
Best butterfruit milkshake ever. Other milkshakes are also good. The French fries is 45 rupees, the quantity is more than enough for two people,, and it tastes good and crispy.
The food is delicious !! The service is extremely good, especially Mr. Susant pal was very prompt!! Must visit
Pav bhaji Cheese fondue, Mexican tortilla papdi chat Both are to die for...so yummy  All the chats are very sweet in taste not at all spicy! Great presentation of dishes  Overall a great experience!
The taste here is not so much gud . I personally dint lik the taste of Manchurian ,biryani, cheese balls. Its a over hyped place.
Food is too good. Please give it a try

Amazing concept of bringing millets in the menu!!! Whatever we ordered was good and tasty! A bit over crowded!
Service By Gowda was a amazing experience
This was the closest restaurant to my hotel, wanted to try something authentic south Indian food. So few people suggested me south ruchi, food here is decent enough but the service in the restaurant is very slow.
Tomato soup could have been bitter if it was thick. I would highly recommend to have Palak Dal Khichdi. It was amazing. Best place for family visit. Need to try Jaljeera Lime Soda (Salted) at the end. It was really good. Next time I would try South Indian Thali. It has good varieties of items.
""
Very good taste and fully organic food..it's a good initiative to be oraganic
""
If you are a health conscious person, this is the place you need to go! The speciality of this place is food cooked here is organic. They also offer some healthy drinks like beetroot juice, detox drink,..
As you enter this rustically designed place what strikes you is the extremely courteous staff, smilingly welcoming you to a great experience. The focus is really to make the customer feel special and not only this they ensure to serve the very best, healthy and narural food without any compromise on taste.
This is a beautiful place. Delicious food, amazing service only one complain the parking area is pathetic. I still give a 5 star, but a request ease have the parking space fixed.
Good food...good ambience...lots of food....üòçüòç
Loved this place! A very classy dinner Loved the pineapple fried rice , murgh biriyani and the pizza, staff was excellent at service .

This place serves best icecream and this place is know for Tava pulav. The taste of tava pulav is very nice....but the taste is reduced when compared to before. They are also well known for there special sundaes, but it's a bit expensive. They have both self service and dining with cute and good ambience.
Richie rich       This place serves yummy ice creams and snacks This place is opened till 1:30am and that‚Äôs pretty cool.  People love their signature sundaes and tawa pulav.  We love their cheese tawa pulav and ice cream sundaes. Planning to go out and eat something at this time, then Richie rich should be the place. Pricing is slightly on the higher side.

Kava by marriott is of the top fine dine places in rajajinagar and I visited this place recently and i had a nice overall experience, the buffet had all sorts of appetisers among which i loved the boneless chicken one and i loved their chats . The staff were very kind and hospitable , the place is big and seating is comfortable, the cocktails were very nice and served well , from the main course i loved everything from the breads to the rice items , the dessert section had plenty of options to choose from and i liked most of them . If you want the fine dine experience and good food then this is the place to go to .  Taste :4/5 Ambiance:4/5 Service:4/5
Kava by Marriott at rajajinagar offers one of the finest buffets with varients in both veg and non veg dishes.Ambience is peaceful and poised.Staff are extremely humble üî∂In the starters we were tried the Malai panner,corn tikkis and aloo fry.I personally loved the corn tikkis with that yummy mint chutney  üî∂The chats which were dahi puri , dahi papdi,Pani puri and aloo tikki chat tasted delicious  üî∂In the main course I fell in love with sarso da saag and makki di roti here.I reckon you to taste this one.Jeeera and Wadi pulav was great.I felt the hare moong ki daal was a little too watery which was conveyed to them later.The other gravies tasted pretty good  üî∂They have almost 5 different types of salads like chicken, egg , panner and vegetable salads for health conscious people  üî∂In desserts they had assorted pastries, 2 types of halwas,Malai gulla,laddos and jalebis.They were not just eye pleasing but also tasted absolutely delightful .Malai gulla and carrot halwa are my personal favourites  üî∂In addition to this the mocktails and cocktails are also served but are not a part of the buffet  Overall a great experience but has scope for improvement.I would definitely visit this place again
Kava, a fine fine Indian kitchen nestled at Fairfield by Marriott rajajinagar is all set to bring out the punjabi in you with their very celebratory Punjab di shaan ( the pride of punjab) - rangla sardar menu where you can indulge in delectable culinary preparations curated from the land of 5 rivers.  Priced at Rs 1099+ taxes, this will be on until the 25 of January. The very splendid menu comprises of everything from laisuni chicken tikka too makke ki roti and sarsoan da saag. This buffet has something for each and every age group. Pair your food with beverage recommendations from the very courteous staff at kava.  Loved the chaats to the chicken biryani and nalli nihari. Also, the kukkad makkhanwala malai tasted brilliant with some cheese naan. To end the meal, I couldn't have asked for anything better than Jalebi naal rabdi ( jalebi and rabdi ) and some pastries. Would highly recommend that you make a reservation prior to your visit.
Kava is one of the fine dine authentic indian cuisine restaurants present in Fairfield by Mariott rajajinagar. The ambience is very decent with a huge seating capacity and a large variety of dishes to offer in the buffet. To start the buffet we were served the papdi chaat which is one of the best i have had in bangalore. Then came the dahi puri which was also very good and not to forget the paani puri. All the varieties of chaats are just amazing. We were also given a basket of crispy papads to savour. Then came in the non veg starter platter which contained of variety of tikkas and fish, the fish was not of a very great quality but tasted good. The tikkas were marinated very well and cooked to perfection. But one variety of them contained bones which I didn't expect to be and was a little disappointing. For drink, I had the watermelon mint mojito which was just absolutely amazing. Then we were served pav with chicken kheema which contained butter toasted pav which was mind boggling. We were also served makke di roti and sarso ka saag which was the highlight of the evening as it was out of the world good. For main course, I had zafrani murgh pulao and kukkad da makkhan wala. The pulao was spicy just the way I like it and the curry was just the perfect combination I needed for the pulao. Then I also had the steam rice with rasam and it just reminded me of how it was made at home. Absolutely brilliant. To go to desserts, I had the garam garam jalebis, moong dal halwa, gajar ka halwa and a variety of pastries. All of them were very good. Except for the fact that the gajar ka halwa was a bit dry. Do visit this place for a very hospitable staff and experience along with awesome delicacies.
One of the finest buffets in Bangalore. I really liked the ambience and food. Staffs were friendly and helpful. The music was good. Well maintained. Even the crowd was good. Buffet is worth the price. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends n family.
Best place for a cool shake and awesome foodüòç

Beautiful place, visited 4 times and still feels like i never get enough of it.I have been here once with my partner and the rest of the times with large group of friends, its a great place to be on a weekend.
A wonderful place to spend time chill out with your bae and friends with an amazing view . FOOD AT ITS BEST. Pizza is a must try.  #stayhappy #stay hungry
Small rooftop with great ambience. Lovely crowd, Great music and tasty food. Menu reasonably priced. I had a great time and recommend it to othersüëçüèº
Lol, I wish I can be polite. Leave you won't understand
good quality of food and service by rishi
The food was really good as usual. Our waiter (Gopal) was very good in serving us. Overall really good service from Gopal
Well, well! One of my favorite places! I am a hardcore fan of sbow!üòÖ..Cheese and masala fries ( though I thought it was loaded fries) served with three delicious mayonnaise sides: orange one tastes similar to the dynamite sauce of kfc, not spicy at all;one white sauce with caramelized garlic, the third was a plain white mayonnaise but tasted more buttery! Second dish: Mumma‚Äôs mutton Dhansak... again I thought it was mutton biryani ü§™.. this is our typical ‚Äúkadhu (bottle gourd) mutton & mixed dal,(dalcha)served with slightly sweet, a bit dry and brown colored rice, garnished with caramelized onions. One amazing thing to note is that this came in a tiffin carrier (those nostalgic moments) The drink: Their special martini espresso...with hazel nut syrup and coffee ( more like an Irish coffee, but this was ‚Äúvodka‚Äù in place of ‚Äúwhiskey‚Äù). Verdict: as always they are the best.. and on the portion size, Dhansak serves only one. Fries can be sharedü§™ I have tried their kheema pav with extra butter and tomato macaroni before, yum! Great ambience! Sunday is a bit crowded so book ahead!
We visited this place on a Sunday afternoon. Berry pulao, Raspberry soda and Eggs Kejriwal are a must try. Loved the service of Mr Gopal
Must try berry pulao, raspberry soda and dhansak. Very good service by Gopal.
I was here for our office party and hard rock caf√© is definitely not the right place for an office gathering. This place miserably failed in hosting a private party. We had requested for a dance floor and they basically had created a small space from the seating area to dance which did not make sense to me at all. There was even hardly any space to dance.   Service was very disappointing .The staff had no coordination within themselves and they were serving starters in very less quantities for a large group due to which the waiting time grew and a few left the place without having food. The time taken to serve starters were not acceptable at all and the staff also seemed very casual and ignorant.The manager too wasn't taking any personal interest to resolve this issue. The main course was pathetic. There were rotis but no Subzi. There was plain rice but no curry with rice. There were hardly 6 items on the buffet main course for our group and it was super disappointing.  It‚Äôs definitely not a place for group or office parties and this place shouldn‚Äôt be even entertaining private parties if they cannot make appropriate arrangements for the same. Had lots of expectations from this place for its brand name but a place I will not visit again nor recommend anyone. Anyways I am not a Rock music enthusiast.
Great service by John.....he arranged us a table in the very last minute.......made my day.....god bless !!

Loved the food, everything we ordered was extremely tasty! Definitely had a great time & plan on visiting again soon.
Misu is definitely one of the finest pan Asian restaurants in Bangalore. I would like to specially thank Manob who was our steward for the day - he was extremely courteous and very helpful in choosing our food.
We ordered 2 starters and 1 noodles the taste was very average but the noodle was yum ... Quality and Quantity both were not upto the mark.
Great ambiance. Great food. Great service. This place has it all. A must visit place for all the beer lovers out there.
1st visit to this place during weekends and it was jam packed. This place has good vibes.  I'm not a beer expert but loved few samplers. Bangalore bliss was very mild with good flavours infused. That was my favorite.  *Mediterranean salad was not up to the mark. Flavour was good but lettuce was bitter.  *Siracha chicken wings were done well. Was not spicy but it had good flavours.  *Potato skins was delicious. It's highly filling because of cheese and mashed potatoes.  *Crispy calamari quantity was less but taste was good.  *Bangalore nachos was my favorite. Loved every bite. Best with beer or any other cocktail or mocktail. Most recommended.  Moderately expensive. A must try place for all beer lovers.
""
It's the classiest brewery in the city! Range of Ales is mind blowing. We did not really order main course, just some munchies. I really loved the sweet potato fries.
One of my fav place to chill out. Like the ambience and the brewed beers. Like the starters here too. Will keep visiting
I am utterly in love with the pizzas here. Brik Oven has the best pizzas I have ever had, by far. Thankyou for the feta cheese (my absolute favourite). I love the range of cheeses they have that I can choose from. I hope you keep adding more authentic pizzas so I will never fall out of love with you, Brik O!
The best and the tastiest pepperoni pizza I ever had
""
The thin pizza is amazing plus the Oreo shake too and they cook in front of u itself coz its an open kitchen, the place is awesome ü§©
The place is fab not only in terms of interiors and service but also in terms of their food apart from they being for¬† famous for their pizza's they also are amazing when it¬† comes to their waffles is what I strongly believe as they are soft as along with having the best toppings no matter which you select I tried two of the waffle flavors¬†  Nutty Professor: this is having chocolaty topping with Nutella and Ferrero rocher sprinkled on it perfect if you are a chocolate lover¬†  Strawbreeze as mentioned in the menu they have fresh cut strawberries on top with strawberry sauce spread all over that's just mouthwatering¬†  now coming to their famous pizza part¬†  the anna: if you looking for more veggies in your pizza this is the best on to opt for as the veggies topped on the dough that's so soft which is evident when you pull it apart not only to see how evident it is to see the cheese that's spread very generously but also the base is soft and melts as you take a bite in¬†  the hangover: this drink might make you feel a bit heavy as its made with bananas

This place has two parts : one with music and one without (ebony). Unfortunately we ended up in the former and the evening was ruined since we could barely hear each other. Food and drinks were nice. We had ordered a Burmese khao suey and corn dumplings. In drinks we ordered a whiskey cocktail with rose honey.  The place has decent pricing, which was a surprise, Staff are well mannered. DJ played good upbeat music. The view from the rooftop is good. Overall, a satisfactory experience which could‚Äôve been better.
Wonderful mesmerizing roof top ambience, unbelievably romantic .... Best suitable for couples for romantic dinners .... Had long island tea and beer with dahi ke kebab and tandoori mushrooms.....food was over all very tasty ..... Overwhelmed by the place and had a wonderful experience of the top night view!
Beautiful ambience and scrumptious food- a must try if you are ready to splurge on good food.

No response and worst customer service. Yesterday i have ordered through zomato and informed the moni restaurant that there is some items missing in that but then there were no response from the moni restaurant side.This shows the responsibility of customer service both the restaurant and moni restaurant.
Best food around . Good quantity .one of the best around vit . Try this restaurant once .worth trying I tried All veg ,Non veg items starters very good taste
10 people went and bill came around 1.3k only.Satisfactory food . Very much worth the money. Very good in taste and Service. Also restaurant is family friendly. Small place so better to go early. Prefer AC dining. Only Cons I would say is Chicken was only NV in the menu, coukd keep more varieties is menu Also, Non AC dining is lil hot and smokey!
Very were good food all so fresh and fully hygiene place and customer friendly to
Best hotel with cheap price with quality and quantity.I liked very much the way they served us.but they want to increase little bit tastes and menu.soups are very good paratha also quite good gravys are ok.
Ate Prawn Biryani, really not satisfactory. Few prawns added to veg biryani. Definetly was not expecting this. I hope you guys improve the taste.
Good packing of the food and tasty . You should try it once. I ordered online from this restaurant. Keep this and server us better . #thankyou.

First restaurant I visited in South and it was best one. The food they serve is exceptionally good. Both South Indian and North Indian food in reasonable prices.
Awesome food . Giving rating  Food taste 4/5¬†  Ambience 4/5  Service 5/5  Speed of food serving 5/5  Team 5/5. One of the top veg restaurant in Mysore Road
Didn't expect great North Indian food However the north Indian food was unexpectedly good. Also the ice creams were quite nice.i refer dal tadka, mutter paneer and gudbud icecream
Good south indian and north I Dian food. Place is clean and service is quick. Ordered manchow soup which was very different from what you usually get. Big chunk of chilly made it super spicy. Veg patiyala was good and paneer tikka butter masala was average. Butter kulchas were super soft. 3 pieces of medium pooris in one plate comes with a small katori of sabji and some chatni. Overall a very good experience for a quick meal on the go.
Food is fine. I liked the pepper chicken dry. The garlic was crispy in that. Mutton kolhapuri wasn't spicy at all. Kadai chicken was okayish. But the way they had segregated sitting for family and others was nice
Pathetic & horrible place to hangout. Lacks cleanliness. Food was below par and pricey for the quantity and taste they had served us. You'll face a lot of mosquito problems if you're planning to visit in the evening. Wouldn't recommend this place anyday!
One of the most nearby dhabas from city... crowded most of the times... not ideal for ladies... nice place to hangout.. good quality and quantity of food offered...
The food here was pretty well! But the service is very bad! We waited almost 25-35 minutes after ordering our food!  Food wise, its quite worth place to eat and spend some peaceful time! üòä
Not a great place for family. But for youngsters like us it's the best. People who knows daba well will know what I am talking about. Biryani is great and one thing for what I will go there again and again is Ghee chicken roast. Absolutely mouthwatering
The food here is miserable. For a highway location like this, they can do well if they care to prepare good non veg. Including they can have customers coming from nearby residential areas. Hope the owner will care to understand what is good food
Worst food provided plz dont dare to go . We ordered hyderabadi Biryani it was like chicken in green chilli paste and raw tasting not cooked well. Roti and butter naan was so thick flat breads not good.
Pathetic service.   Food is not at all good and they charge higher price. The staff was friendly.  Not even half the items in menu will be available
Good Food/Kebab's home delivery to Goodearth Malakar on timeüëçüëå.
Worst Service. Please dont try. Keeps fish and says vegetarian. Servers don't know what they are serving. Also worst attitude like If you don't want get lost!
Awesome taste good ambience üòÅ the really taste of Kathi rolls love the taste of u want to eat roll visit this place and the owner is so polite ..
Nice place for cakes üëçüëå the cakes was yummy and the best cakes I've ever tasted , and cakes was awesome flavor and true quality and they prepare cakes in 15min ....

This is the amazing place for hangout. Mahogany Tripple IPA was super. And also with Chicken Nachos, Chicken ghee roast was too yummy ü§™... Thanks to Chinmay and Sangam for excellent suggestive food and Excellent Service
Thanks for the service and warm welcome from Indrajit. Good food and nice ambience
The ambience is lovely with great lighting. We ordered Nachos and Paneer tikka in starters, both were really good. The beers are ok though.
Delicious food and good service by sameer
The Dessert platter was amazing. Chicken Nasila is a must try. Hummus Pita was better than most places in Bangalore . Bharat served us so well.
The Pioneers in inventing brewed beer concept in Bangalore, I was here for an office party and loved the atmosphere and ambiance. The place was buzzing with a lot of people. The beer was great as expected but I was disappointed with the buffet. There were a lot of options in the spread but it was lacking quality specially the desserts.  Good service and nice atmosphere in the roof top seating area. Lots of space to park your cars and bikes. If you live in the heart of Bangalore, travelling here is a hassle. Recommended
One of the classiest interiors in a brewery. The paneer tikka was good,the bombay pav was spicy and nice. Loved the pecan pie. Only con was the service which was incredibly slow at times.
It is one of my favourite places in Bengaluru. What I love about the place is it‚Äôs ambience and customer service. Food and drinks are also good, though I am not a beer lover, I prefer having sangria there whenever I visit With my friends :)
Professional, nice and available staff, especially Sharuq who is very friendly, thoughtful, knowledgeable, helpful and professional. Very nice place to eat, drink, listen to music, read, for families and friends. The decoration is amazing and the staff is very welcoming.  One of my favorite restaurants/bars In Bengaluru!
Visited the place couple of weeks back with my team. The ambiance is just fabulous and gives you a relaxing feeling. Books all around you gives you a mixed feelings of nerd and intellect.  They do have a valet parking with no slips, a code will be sent on your phone upon your arrival and while departure you have to inform the same to get your vehicle.  We have ordered a list of brew beers and a good number of food. The beers were superb in taste but on the other foods, specially the main course we're disasters. On the starters the chicken wings, garlic bread (one of the best) and french fries with honey were delicious in taste. But the risotto and the veg pastas were really bad.  Eventually, the taste of the risotto was somewhat giving us a brunt flavour. I called out the chef for the same but the Steward Shahrukh clearly said he can't call the chef and gave us 2 choices either to order something from the starters menu as a replacement or just cancel out the risotto order.  Now comes the service, which tends to be one of the most pathetic service I have ever encountered. Steward Shahrukh and Alvin were rude, uncourteous and with a different attitude, be it for taking the orders, placing the services, talking to the guest.  Ambiance can make a difference but your services created the difference. A big no to this place for me.  Ambiance: 3/5 Food: 3/5 Service: 1/5
Souren Nandy was a really good fellow, he was smart one
The food tastes good. Service was quick.
I have been a regular visitor of Punjab Grill. This time the visit was disappointing because the meat was undercooked in butter chicken. Though when raised we were given another dish but then the gravy consistency was different.
Yesterday we had dropped in for dinner at punjab grill, its our favourite place to savour tandoori murgh and chicken biryani. Biryani was little salty... But we got it replaced very quickly. Pan shots were really amazing. The staff was really good and polite. This is one of the best restaurant that serves authentic punjabi cuisine. All time favourite!!
We visited for team lunch(~20 members) today at this restaurant for Buffet. The food was really pathetic for the price ( 950/- per buffet) paid. After we were done with starters many of the folks started feeling really uncomfortable and heavy. After we reached office few of the fellow colleagues even vomited. I would not refer this place to anyone for any further team lunches.
I wanted to visit this place for their really pretty and variety of cakes. The cakes were delicious, and so were the cupcakes. The ambience of this place is lovely and I will come back to try their food.

During my recent visit to white fields Bangalore I came across this Cafe located quite near to the crossroads The ambiance was spectacular and modern It was quite cozy and peaceful The staff was attentive and polite Talking about the food we ordered for: Country style farmhouse pizza: Thin crust pizza loaded with toppings n cheese. It was interesting to see different shapes slices this time Spaghetti with smoked chicken n broccoli on cheese sauce. Very interesting as the spaghetti was different than the regular ones we get in the market. Tres leches (specialty milk cake made with 3 different milk) was very soft and tasty. I liked it so much ordered for one more And Their in-house special golden roses chocolate cake. Last but not the least this was my favorite overall. It was not only beautiful to look at but very tasty to eat. A must visit for sure Location: Ground floor, Epip Zone, Near BMTC Bus Depot, Whitefield, Bangalore

Good food and servuce
The food is pathetic as per the price. Don't try buffet here, there is a lot of other option better than this restaurant.Service is slow and in buffet system everything served on the table even the main course...I would have really gave negative pts to this restaurant bt zomato does not have that feature.The restaurant is not even worth for 1 star rating.
Worst service ever..took hours to serve.. please don't visit..worstplace and services..food was also not that great
Ashok and other people were really good. The service staff is great and very well behaved.
Service is awesome, we appreciate Ashok's effort to make the visit remarkable... Food is very good and worth a try.
Had a great experience...Ashok the guy who attended my table was awesome
Nayan's service was really good!!
The food was too good and thanks for celebrating my bday. Special thanks to Sachin for serving us better
Courteous staff. Excellent taste and quality. Value for money.

Food taste was very bad. Tasteless
I received food that was half eaten by the delivery guy. The seal was broken and the box was half empty

We ordered food via zomato , they updated after an hour to the zomato valet that they are out of stock , y accpet the order in first place when ur out of stock ,atleast if were informed we could have ordered somewhere else.
i ordered a quinoa upma for breakfast apart from it being extremely distasteful the quantity was very less for the money they priced
Dont order from here. Even if its free or someone pays you to eat this. Everything is horrible.

Famous for chocolate coffee with varieties of breakfast it‚Äôs famous for Dosa ad idly chutney and ambience was cool interior design was nice
Nice place to spend with family and friends. Quick service is provided. They have varities of menu provided. I tried roti, veg Kolhapuri, jeera rice and lovers special icecream. Overall, Food - 5/5 Ambience - 5/5 Service - 5/5
I ordered for chicken American choupsey but these ppl gave veg American choupsey... when I questioned this staff were very rude to me they are arguing n asking me to pay extra amount for chicken AC ... really waste they don't know to handle customer n sort out the issue
Used to be my go to place for dinner parcels. The food is okayish, but the service is not good at all. Once they gave only half the quantity of what I ordered. There was a smirk on the person handing over the parcel to me at the restaurant, which made me believe that the staff had eaten some of the food from it. I'm not sure to this date.
This is my 2nd order from this Restaurant.. It's just Awesome taste & worth for the cash paid.. Loved it.. üòçüòòüëåüíû
Ambience is all well and good. Staff's and managers are well responsive. Ambience could be improved , decent place to dine out with family. Very well maintained and restaurant is spacious in terms of area. Good quality and quantity. Chicken biriyani tastes awesome. Starters such as chicken Manchurian, dry etc are mouth watering. Tried kulcha with chicken amritsari , it was really a worthy one, it was so tasty . Often choose here to dine out from past 3 years . Overall good quality of food with pocket friendly rates and happy to be here !!

A very good place for a takeaway and has a wide range of North , South Indian ,chinese delicacies . It also has an a/c restaurant, the best delicacies of this restaurant is mughlai biryani and veg hydrabadi their tastes are worth to die for!!!!
Misses any one item of low value.. low response.. great neglegence towards customer. I ordered 5 items received 4 items... If I did chat with support got stupid reply...
Best  nort indian food iloved it fast serving and better taste than any other hotels near by. It has a place for family wit ac halls i m in love with the taste
I had been to this franchise last week n ordered for cappuccino n few cutlet it was very much worst the food they served was black n even the cappuccinos taste was not good I asked the waiter whats wrong with this coffee he told me that machine problem....  If there is problem in machine why would they serve.... Was very much dissapointed..

I had high regards for CCD brand but this outlet has disappointed me for the second time in 2 months. Please be alert and check your bills thoroughly if you visit this outlet.  They add extra items in the bill without taking concern of the customer. When asked, they say 'Its complementary' and yet they charge you for it. We ordered a cappuccino and a green tea but they added 2 cookies to the bill without asking me and have billed me for the same. See the attached pic for the proof. They did return me Rs.30 by cash but if people do not check their bills, they may actually think it was complementary and get cheated at this outlet.
"Any meetups , hangouts , sudden coffee treats first place that pops up in mind s coffee day ..üòä.. Usually said as "" macha ccd""( means  meetup in coffee day ) Coming to menu .. Everything s good üòò"
This place is located in nagarbhavi and usually not crowded. There are many tables and parking is not at all a problem here. Clean place and service is quick too. The outside seating has few fans here and there, however the there is a always a wind flow, which doesn't make you feel uncomfortable.  I feel this is the one CCD where I can rely upon taste, it doesn't change every time I visit.

delivery boy told me not to order for such a far address even though the zomato app has no problem
Good place to have quick bites and must try here is idly vada , pav bhaji , dosas and rotis . Tastes good and desserts are also fine coffee is also good
Had been for lunch here. Service is satisfactory. Place and food served is clean. Price seems ok. Taste is good. Ambience is not nice, need to work on it. Overall experience is satisfactory, not great.
Nice place to visit taste food available in dis place vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods are gud, dey service good food and waiters suggests us to get taste food for us and even dey are well dressed up as official , I suggest to visit this place
Sadly there is no negative rating available here!!  First time I visited this place....well and the last time too... The food was served one hour after ordering (even water was served after an hour after requesting many times) and was very little in quantity and quality was bad...the kalmi kebab was burnt and hard and each leg piece costed rs.80. absolutely not worth the cost. Had to cancel all the dishes and walk out after a long wait of one hour. The food definitely is not worth the wait and and our money.  And the waiters were too careless and ignorant to even listen to what we say.  People who are hungry and people who want good food.. please do not enter this place!!
Opposite to BDA complex, nice ambiance and delicious food what else you need for perfect dine out. All the staffs are well mannered and serve the food with good attitude. Only downside is the price, which is on bit higher side.
Service is a stand out!! Courteous and happy staff. Food is good. Andra meals are just perfect. Tried Chicken clear soup, it was made well. Clean, peaceful, air-conditioned restaurant. Good for work lunch.
Okayish restaurant. Prices are comparatively high. Not that great taste also. But you will find hi-tech hospitality service when you enter the restaurant. Well there will be 3-4 magagers/ staff's to welcome you. Staff's are we'll trained and they behave decently with customers. Food is not that great. It's kind of Okayish . Starters tasted good . Prawns rava fry was the best in the menu , we had never tasted any prawns starter like this before. It was very tasty and crunchy served hot hot. Chicken items were average. Fish items were bit expensive compared to other restaurants. It was overall a average experience. But really prawns starters are the must try here. Basically not a pocket friendly restaurant , prices are bit higher compared to others in the locality.

Worst food, ordered veg sandwich, sev puri and oreo milkshake... sev puri was worst of the worst never had anything like that before went straight to garbage, sandwich had only mashed raw potatoes and nothing else. Oreo milkshake was thick and atleast taste was good so 1 star. I would never order any chats from this outletüôèüèª
Ordered online Masala Puri, Twistato, Bhel Puri and Vada Pav. Masala puri was ok, though the puris were fresh, the masala was just ok. Twistato was a disaster was soggy as it was a parcel. Packaging was not good. Same story with Bhel puri. Vada Pav was descent.
I ordered Oreo milkshake and butter fruit milkshake from this outlet! Delivery was fast! I got my order in very good condition and milkshake was amazing! Just quantity was a bit low everything else is great! Nice place
Where to find that my order is not for door step but for just a home delivery that your delivery boy didn‚Äôt came upstairs to my flat to deliver the order even after i have given my full address ?

Pathetic food and taste.. my brother came to home hyderabad, and in hurry i ordered from kaju masala and mushroom biryani . Masala is more and some bad smell and added some kind bad masala . The total food is completed composted and sting like anything. Entire night suffered from stomach pain after eating some little bit quantity. How you guys are able make this restaurant into zomato gold ? First remove this and add some good restaurants. Otherwise there is no use of zomato gold
Spilling issues.Food quality worst(stale food) .items missing in thali ... please don't order from this restaurant.waste of money.
Food is good reasonable price highly recommend
What kind of cheating is this they include more items and give inadequate quantity of food. It‚Äôs not even close to snack item. The salad was very cold
""

Whenever we have ordered biryani they are not sending salad along with order.
I ordered tandoori and they deliver with damage pices. Waste money waste and they are not responded ofter delivery
Have Ordered mushroom biryani and instead of mushroom its full of Myda balls! When you Take money for it please serve better food or else shut down last time I have ordered chicken biryani and it was full of gobi!! It was my favourite place at one point of time but now you are really serving a very very cheap quality food please don‚Äôt do this again

Most amazing rolls I ever had. My daily meals is from fassos and I am never bored eating. They maintain the standard as top notch. No matter what I order I know am gonng enjoy it. The never stop surprising with good food, even biryani. 5star service #delicious #hotserved #fastservice #bestrolls

If there‚Äôs a Biryani that I‚Äôve had And will remember for a long time it is this. Cz this is the worst biryani I‚Äôve had. There‚Äôs literally no taste to food delivered from here. Like no salt, no spice. Just boiled rice and some chunks of paneer.  Pathetic and disappointing.
""
I ordered fish fry. But you have delivered wrong item. Ordered the same before, that time the fish fry was good as expected. So repeated the same order. Unfortunately got disappointed by the wrong item.
The WORST BIRIYANI IN BANGALORE! CANT EAT! I DEMAND A REFUND IF YOU HAVE ANY SHAME!
@Biriyani darbar served chicken piece in veg Biriyani..this kind of mistakes are really unacceptable...it's fine with the non vegetarian people somehow they can manage but what about the vegetarian guys...u guys are breaking trust of people with these silly mistakes...please be little responsible...
Very bad service. Never order from this outlet. They take more than hour to deliver and are very arrogant
:( ruined it on the very day I gave 5 stars :( bad service

I ordered a Veg Extravaganza and my pizza was supposed to be delivered in 30 mins. However, no pizza was delivered to me despite crossing 1 hour time period. When I called them for assistance, they hanged up the phone immediately after picking up, not letting me to even speak hello. Later they put the receiver on the side to prevent any incoming calls. 1.5 hrs later I got my pizza. It was totally cold & not at all worth eating. I was about to complain them for their rude behaviour in consumer court, but didn't since my order arrived & I was very hungry. This behaviour, rudeness & untimely delivery is totally unacceptable. I'll never order a pizza from them ever again.
Ordered pizza mania...4 types of pizza in just 230 rs. Thats awesome. We had a good party today. Came on time.. Just 1 min late then expected...but I will give try again to check. Crust could be little better though.  I reordered tonight. I got wrong order. So i called outlet. Initially they said they will send correct order in few minutes. But when i didn't get the order in 30 min. I called back. That lady cut the phone once she get to know I was talking about that order. And now they are not picking up. Wtf? This is how you guys run the outlet. Poor attitude. I would not order from Dominos again. Pizza hut serves better
The neer dosa combo was delicious and the price was appropriate. Small improvement would be if they had given neer dosas separately to add to the combo.
Wow!! Very nice restaurant. Food is so tasty with great price... pure Mangalore style food is available here with original taste...

Fynkin* awesome heavenly food.. amazing..
Nice food quality and nice customer support for billing and order food Nice food quality and nice customer support for billing and order food Nice food quality and nice customer support for billing and order food
We love andhra chilli chicken of this restaurant... Tastes really good...  But why don't you take home delivery orders now... When this service will be started again...
Trust me.. rode side food taste will be much better than Pallavi restaurant food.  Looks like they use same oil for all deep fry items, so it's difficult to differentiate the taste of chicken lollipop and chicken kebab.
Please do not serve stale food, we trust and place order but serving pathetic food is not just breaking trust but also playing with others health, if you guys are not capable enough to serve good food you can reject the order rather just to make some money serving stale food is harmful.
AN AMAZING RESTAURANT WHICH SERVES AT LATE NIGHT. PERFECTLY FITS INTO EVERYONE'S POCKET. THE BEST AT THE CHEAPEST.  I am a frequent customer of this restaurant they never disappoint me.  Kindly improve a little in providing Cutlery and side items. Otherwise you are the best.

"Sitara Veg Restaurant is located in Electronics City nearby to Symbiosis college. Most of the times it is crowded with young college students and IT Professionals.   Sitara Veg Restaurant is a big restaurant and there is seating arrangement facility like inside and outside. Vehicle can be parked outside of the restaurant.

The chicken wings with fries was a disaster - slimy wings coated in heaps of flour and fried . The fish fingers - worst that i have tasted. Pepperoni pizza and mac and cheese with bacon pizza - was worse than the wings . They even managed to destroy the coke , which could just be poured into a glass from a bottle or can . Flat coke that wasnt even cold. When we talked to the staff about it - they said it was just poured.  One of the worst food experiences I have ever had.

Asif has been amazing! The way he served the table is more than fabulous. Would love to visit again.
Diesel Cafe was one of the first places in Mangalore that served great continental food with an experimental menu and I must say they are still going strong.  Visited the restaurant with my mother for lunch. The staff was very courteous and the ambience, fun. We ordered the Chicken and Cheese Cigars, Gangnam Chicken and a main course of Paprika Prawns with Popcorn Mash.  The starters were great and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. The main course of prawns and popcorn mash was a hit and miss. The prawns were well seasoned and cooked to perfection but the popcorn mash is an acquired taste. A little more of the chilli-oil garnish would have enhanced the taste.  Overall, a wonderful experience. I would want to visit again to try their famed Breakfast menu.  One suggestion would be to reduce the volume of music especially when only one or two tables are occupied.
üíûBest shakes and tasty food in town.. memories.. hangout üíû
Diesel cafe needs no intro! Been here on multiple occasions and never disappointed. We recently also tried their new menu which includes- Ghee roast shrooms Dessert platter Nonveg Sui Mai dumpling Veg dumplings And lots more. Our favourite was definitely the dim sum and the Cookie dough dessert is NOT TO BE MISSED üòç
From the decor to the menu, everything is extremely well thought out in this place. The vastness of the menu, complimented by the careful preparation provides a splendid experience. It lives up to its name as a cafe by bringing forth a splendid selection of beverages. The only thing holding me back from giving it a perfect rating is the finesse, which is a little lacking in this place. A little more attention to detail would be appreciated.
Diesel Cafe has always been on my favorite list. Thanks to their new menu, I've fallen more in love with them.  I tried : 1. K-Pop Pancakes : Fluffy and soft pancakes, with crispy chicken in Korean BBQ sauce on top and served with coleslaw. The flavor was new and nice.  2. Devil's on horseback : One of my favorites in the breakfast menu. Sausages wrapped in bacon, mashed potatoes, omlette, everything was on point  3. Crunchy Munchy Noodle Pizza : A new one to the menu absolutely won my heart. Really crispy noodles topped with veggies and chicken in schezwan sauce and melted cheese on top.  4. Brownie Point, my forever favorite, and the best waffles üíú

Froth on top This place is one place most young Mangaloreans have been to with their gang! As the name suggest, the place only serves beer. The ambience is super chilled and perfect for hanging out with your group. They have indoor as well as outdoor seating, so you can choose according to your mood. Their food menu is very well curated and has some really nice items. The food in general tastes good and is served hot. We love their Pork hot garlic, Chicken Nuggets, Lasagna and Kheema rice. These are definite must try from here.

"It's sad this place runs by a 4.1 star rating on zomato. The ambience: Atrocious. Seems like a shady and shabby restaurant from the early 80's. Wif of stale musk smell as you enter. I'm not quite sure what people rave about the thai chicken. And the chicken chopsuey. They were both awful. The ""Thai"" chicken , i'm wondering what was even thai about it! The chopsuey, was salty, the egg was fried on both sides and SMELLY. Amidst all of these negatives, I must say, when our wait staff was informed, he was kind enough to offer a replacement. Revamp this place to, maybe just bring back the glory days of hao ming?!"

All time favorite and one of the first Chinese restaurant I had been to, over the years very little has changed this place, very good üëçüèª the Peking pork is delicious.  Ambience can be better.

I visited this place thrice and I really enjoyed the food here.   I would like to write review based on my last visit.   Ordered  keung chicken as starter which was good, chicken arrabiata pasta tasted flavourful,  peri peri chicken burger , hot chocolate mud pie with ice cream it was too yummm (Highly recommended ) and  blackforest cake which wasn‚Äôt good at all. ‚òπÔ∏è  Had few more dishes on my other visits. I don‚Äôt remember their namesü§™  Ambience: Its too pleasant. Nice ambience. I would say its perfect place to hangout

Had been at this place with friends. Ordered quite a few stuffs like Chicken cheese fingers, masala cheese french fries and much more.. Really loved the masala cheese french fries but the prices are really on the expensive side comparing to other restaurants. Overall a great place and ambience for student and young crowd. Amazing decor and execellent staff.
A place with by far the best ambience in mangalore! You an chill and sip over some great shakes and order a quick bite or even have a full fledged meal here. We went for the pasta and some sandwiches and absolutely loved it!

Amazing place!! Just loved the service and foood.... A must visit restaurant in Mlore #AOP pizza #Ice Tea #Grillee chicken with honey and mustard #chicken DimSum
There is no better pizza in Mangalore.Period.It's amazing how such a small joint presents such a diverse menu. The old blue's music that they play goes very well with the it. If it were upto me, I won't change even one thing about trattoria.
Value for money Great ambience  And must have ice tea!  It‚Äôs the best in Mangalore.
I had ordered a pizza .....was not as expected .                                          The pizza was  cold and disappointing , it was all doughy .The cheese on the pizza was cold and hard.I have to say it was not really that great.  I have had much more better pizza than this.                                             The pizza could be compared to a tortilla on which a weird cheese and some cold cut pineapples and toppings were added
The ambience here is good but the pasta I tasted here was not at all good please don't buy pastas here
The food tastes good. Its a known restaurant with fast delivery. waiting to try few more dishes. The location is also great. Now with online delivery available, everyone can get amazing foods at home too
Very nice place for tandoori items like kababs fish tandori and of course the biryani which has an amazing mouth watering taste.  The chicken sauthe or the paneer Sauthe also are good just as the lemon chicken. The gravy dishes are good too my favourite being Chicken makannwalla
Biryani tastes so good and that chilly chicken üòò
I am basically not from Belgaum but have heard so much about Niyaaz and that anything you order form here will be up to mark.So I ordered veg Hong Kong fried rice and was disappointed that it had no veggies in it and not even sent a schezwan sause to enhance the taste thus it was tasting very dry. Hope Niyaaz takes it positively and enhances the quality of other cuisine also.
We were travelling through belgaum and stopped at this place to eat. One of the best Biryanis i have eaten. Each individual rice grains falling away and while you know they have used ghee, it doesnt leave you with a oily hand. Unlike certain other Biryanis that leave you feeling heavy and stuffed the Biryani here was light and refreshed us for the drive ahead. The staff was extremely courteous and also advised us on the quantity that might be required for the size of our group. Thia resulted in zero wastage. Overall a definite place you should visit if you are in Belagaum.
For a restaurant so crowded and renowned it's surprising that service is slow. We visited there 3 times in a week and we faced slowness each time. As far as food is concerned biryani were good but pieces in mutton were well cooked albiet they were small and mostly bony pieces. Shawarma tasted different and good than the ones in Delhi NCR but we ordered 11 in one go and we rec'd the weren't warm enough although they were made right in front of us. If cold shawarma felt good i am feeling how a warm shawarma would have felt.
Love the chicken biryani over there. An authentic Mughlai taste. Also, they make delicious sweet corn chicken soup which is subject to availability of the sweet corn. Don't miss out the Chicken Southee. Got quite a tangy taste to it. Doesn't take a hit on the pocket and always a great experience visiting the restaurant or ordering the food. Been a decade since I've moved out of Belgaum and visiting this place is a must for it's authentic Mughlai food.
The food was tasty! Was expecting a bit more quantity The only thing that bothered me was the manchow soup was bit SWEETISH! Rest the quality was good
Taste is good, I would recommend pack food in box. It will be nice to have that silver color box package for delivering food. Anyway it was a great time to have pop in hotel food.
Ordered dal khichadi. Good packaging

Very tasty food.
Had ordered chicken seekh kabab, recieved it on time but it was cold and tasted awful, even after heating it tasted asif it was made with batter n it did not have any CHICKEN.
The best hotel in Belagavi, food tastes amazing and the service is appreciated. Its must visit for every one. Their Thaicurry, mutton rogan josh, babycorn bezule, lobster, biriyanis are yummmmmm.
Please specify which item is served with chatney. Because u asking for money for extra chatney. Horrible!!! Please dont spoil the image of idli.
Puri was horrible

Being a localite, I had not visited this restaurant. However a friend's birthday treat provided the perfect opportunity for this place. We ordered sweet corn soup which set the tone for the next meal. We then ordered a butter garlic roti and naan, kaju paneer curry and then we finished it with lassi. Paneer and Kaju could have been equally proportioned in the curry. I will definitely visit you again.
Our fav stopover place while way back from Goa. We have stopped at this place couple of times now and found the safe and always tasty. Ghee rice here is a must try.

I had good food Sea shell We oder bbq fish and mutton Raan it's yummy We Enjoyed delicious food Ambience good Service Be friendly staff Overall Experience good
Whole grilled chicken from SAVOURY SEA SHELL, Anna Nagar, Chennai.... This place is very good for sea foods like tandoori prawn, fish etc... Please don't try the non-sea foods ,other than grilled chicken ...The grilled chicken had a moderate taste and the Mutton sheikh kabab was very bad, by fate we went to restaurant at 4:45 pm. We didn't find any other restaurants serving a whole chicken at that point of time. The food was not up to the mark ..Very inconsistent taste.... seriously bad service ,often they served cold dishes and they don't even have the curstosy to heat it before serving to the customer.. . . I believe even posting about the bad quality foods is also the responsibility of the blogger ..
A taste which is ecstatic....cant describe in words    it's better if u experience staffs are very polite and decent .....place is very well groomed.....overall very good place for everyone ...especially couples and friends‚ô•Ô∏èüî•üî•‚ò∫Ô∏è
Food taste is good & yummy
The food was very nice.....service all so good

The ambience is quite peaceful and best suited to visit during the late evening. Fries and brownie with icecream is a must-try. The service was little late but they compensated with the taste.
This place is quite cozy and special for cakes and pastries.They prepare customized cakes for all events like birthdays, anniversaries etc. Ambience was good with a calm environment. The chicken pizza was a thin crust and cheese was perfectly blendedüòã The chessy chicken fries was so yummyü§§ Sizzling Brownie is a must try at this place üíØ

Peri peri fries and sauce were good ..but pasta was a bit of letdown as the cream was sour
There were lot of big sized vegetables that made the wrap taste awful

White house ice-cream - worst ever ice cream in my life. The Ingredients are disgusting that it makes you never even feel like eating ice cream.

Visited twice already and just loved the food especially the service provided by Mr.Vignesh. Definitely would recommend to my friends. Please improve on the washroom facilities and also provide baby chair.

With it, enjoy a splendid spread of booze to gain yourself a high.
The draught beer for me and the green apple martini‚Äôs calls me back to this place every week. The food is good and goes easy on your wallet.
So disappointed! After going to some awesome places in Delhi and Bangalore Chennai's nightlife was thoroughly disappointing. We went on 24 Jan, a friday! They didn't have any of the beers from tje menu except British empire MRP 65/- sold at 189/-. The music... My god! So freaking loud. Music is supposed to compliment the ambiance. But it was so overpowering. So uncomfortable to whisper into the waiters ears and have him whisper back into my ear. I even asked the waiter to ask the dj to reduce the volume a bit. But it didn't register as our waiter was busy on whatsapp. Next, starter arrived. But no plates. Had to ask for plates. Asked for water.. they didn't have normal water, only bottled water. Water bottle arrived. But no glasses. Had to ask for glasses again. Lastly the bill arrived and the feedback back form. But no pen. I chose not to ask again. The star is for the food, which was okay. I guess this is the nightlife standard for Chennai and thats why a 4.3 rating.
Very bad experience ... first - bouncer didn‚Äôt let us enter stating that no place inside and entry is through bookings only, and that to on a weekday,... my frnd, a zomato gold member, did the booking thn n there , which was excepted as well, but still we didn‚Äôt get the entry, on asking again n again he said only couple entry allowed.... after complaining on zomato, their duty manager came and gave us entry, n we see that there was lot of place available inside, many tables were empty... we didn‚Äôt understand why we were not allowed .also, there were very less couples inside, and so many stags were sitting, so why bouncer didn‚Äôt allow us....  after settling down we thought of ordering liquor and we discovered that watever beers they have in menu, non of them is available and they have only 2 options, that was not in Menu... we were surprised seeing all this, and after this much of inconvenience, none of the staff bothered for a sorry even...  I won‚Äôt recommend to visit this place
Checked out this cool place at Anna Nagar for their Unlimited Sunday Brunch menu.¬† The place is themed with all the movie dialogues.¬† I enjoyed the crispy prawns and their Jamaican fish which was so soft.The cocktails and cocktails were beautifully made and some of them are one of a kind.¬† The Menu:- FOOD: Honey Garlic Prawns(FAV) Jamaican Fish Picchu Pota Kozhi (FAV) Set That Peri peri Prawns Crispy Lamb Chicken Kheema Pizza(FAV) DRINKS Cocktails: Glocal¬† Thaaru Maaru¬† Figged Out¬† Maan Karate Absinthe Cocktail (FAV) Mocktail: Takkaru Peela¬† A must try place especially for their ambience

Visited this restaurant (3rd floor, fine-dining one) today with my family (4)  for dinner. Valet car parking and lift available.   Since we went early, we got the road facing table. We ordered veg spring roll, panner manchurian, some breads, aloo-gobi and paneer gravy, veg fried rice, ending with a badam kheer and vannila shakes.  Everything was delicious. The starters alone were little oily, Otherwise üíØ  Will recommend this place to my friends.
Have ordered many times from shree mithai...but this time it's a total disappointment...ordered corn cheese ball bhel purifies and schezwan fried rice Corn cheese ball dis time was a total disaster..2 corn balls had no cheese only...and it dint taste like always nd bhel puri was very very damn sweet.
Love their battura and basundi but difficult to get space during the weekends
""
Worst kind of pizzas delivered to me and no refund or replacement.. very bad place
Local quality . Beef full of fatt
These guys need to learn how to make a proper steak
This place used to be so good but recently when i went , things have changed there and the taste was not good. I hope they take necessary steps and bring back the old taste.
We ordered on Zomato. The beef was badly curated, tough and inedible. The pizza was greasy and tasteless. The only good things were the veg side dish
""
Lot of oil and a hair, landed me in hospital for 2days, I don't have words to explain this!
If want to taste chicken noodles, this place is perfect for that. Also order chicken noodles from here. Taste is perfect. Pocket friendly. Must try chicken noodle.
Best place to have chicken in mysore. This place serves both veg and non veg of good quality. There service is also very fast. Must try there garlic butter naan and malai chicken tikka.

There's no complain about food, it's very tasty but the place has got hygiene issues. If it's a takeaway it's okay but if you are eating there you should be aware that the plates are just quickly rinsed with water, so you would know what the person before you has eaten. The restaurant needs to work on that otherwise there's no complain about food.
""
One of good place to have biriyani. I like the Arabian Mandi chicken biriyani. Addition to that we ordered chicken sahi biriyani, mutton sahi biriyani, pepper chicken, chicken tawa fry, chicken tandoori and titar fry. Price is okay not so pocket friendly. Quantity is good According to ambience it's a very ordinary restaurant
""
My colleague is a health and fitness freak and she always looks out for places serving healthy food. We ordered lunch which got to us in time. Started with a veg salad which had broccoli, sprouted beans and green peas. Good crunch of broccoli which we enjoyed. Ghee rice and chicken curry is a good combination for a single person meal. Nice aroma and flavour of ghee.
Worst food delivered. Butter Naan drenched completely and was rubbery.Tandoori Naan so hard and not properly cooked. Inedible food.Starter and gravy nothing was properly cooked and too spicy. Waste of money
Super
Worst food ever, they pack all the leftovers and send, don't cheat ppl, u won't flourish, ppl don't prefer it anytime

Don‚Äôt know if we went to the restaurant to wait or to eat! Worst ever waiting time.Would never visit again!
La Uppu is located in Grand Mercure, in Mysore. My parents kept raving about this place. This time, I decided to go in here and see the place too. It's quite cute and nice. Loved their ambience. We stayed here and tried their breakfast. It was really nice! I had the pancakes, Parathas and Dosa too. They have 1+1 on Zomato Gold too! I am definitely going to go back!
Pocket friendly restaurant with good service and taste

The best chicken shawarma in the world is found here and i really mean it. I've tried in Bangalore, Bombay, Saudi Arab, Dubai but have not found anything matching SIP AND SNACKS CHICKEN SHAWARMA. Just awesome.
""
The rolls is horrible, full of green chillies. Taste is very bad. Even the malai murg and paneer tikka tastes bad. I really regret going to this place. The water they use for the juice is unhygienic and contaminated. I got severe pharyngitis after dining here. I wouldn't suggest anyone to take their kids here. Also i would like to suggest the hotel management to use clean water and change the cook. When you charge so much for the food you should maintain the quality and hygiene. Definitely don't recommend this place and i would never visit this place ever.
""
We received half the serve we ordered. It was wrong order. Then we had to wait 50minutes for another wrong order. We had to call numerous times to guide the delivery driver to our location. Because of confusion we had cold delayed dinner. Unprofessional service.
Very bad service. Food was stale and staff do not attend your request. Even we found one insect in our food and they don‚Äôt even care. Very bad place
Average food. Amount also very less, for making amount of shawarma they added lot of Onion. Become sweet... 2small piece cubboos only.......
Biryani test was superb nawabi chicken tikka test awesome
""
First of all, my one star review is not the result of one poor delivery and how angry I got by it, I am an ardent food lover and I maintain a page on Instagram (@thedoctorhippie) dedicated to food, I have been having food from this restaurant over many years, I stopped dining here because both the owner and the staff have absolutely zero courtesy and are very rude towards their customers, however since Mysore doesn't offer many options for a decent Hyderabadi Biryani I continued having Biryani's from here through deliveries, over the years the quality of their food has drastically dropped and the delivery quantity is a joke, it's more of a scam I should say, their typical special Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani (dine in) comes with two pieces of chicken (one quarter piece) some chilli chicken, an egg, raita, groundnut chutney and enough rice for two people to eat but if you choose to deliver this you will be given literally half the quantity of everything and no raita or the chutney, I have raised this issue with the staff repeatedly and since I didn't have any more options to resort to, I decided to put up this one star review (if you check my previous reviews you will know I never rate restaurants one star), very disappointing and absolutely hopeless behavior! This is opinion is a result of multiple horrible experiences that I and several of my friends have faced!
""
The biryani had a burnt taste, could not eat at all.
Amazingg place
Excellent restaurant Chicken items are awesome Quantity is also more compared to others Great restaurant From past 20 years I come here itself Very good restaurant
Food quantity is enough but taste is not good. In Chinese menus given options are not available and which are available are not actually taste like chinese. North indian dishes are ok.
I had ordered gobi masala and they have sent mushroom masala üëé mushroom chilly was not good only few pieces of mushroom and they charge 150 rs.....
Blue inn has poor ambience (dim lit), with not so courteous staff, there are only few items on the menu that are good, newbies do try their chicken tikka roll, tandoori chilli, and mutton seekh kabab, pretty much everything else on the menu is below average!
I ordered for a chocolate brownie and they sent walnut and dates pie to me. When I called them, forget apologising, they straight faced told me that this is only chocolate pie, like really?. later someone else tells me arrogantly that they will close zomato because people like us are irritating them and also that they will refund the money. Not once did they apologise, instead arrogantly repeatedly asking me what do I want them to do, it was not about the money but behaviour and service. Which is sooo totally lacking in this so called good place. I wish I could give negative ratings.
They say it vl b dilvered in 32 mins, but after 32 mins when i called the Dolphin, they said madam sometimes it happens...n finally the zomato boy took almost 25 mins to come...i had ordered ice cream which was completely melt...i called n i asked to refund or exchange, the person is so rude...he replied saying madam do what ever u want we are not ready to refund...Money minded people, worst person i spoke with...

Good taste here first time eaten here the taste is like yummm. One must come here and eat some stuff. Lots of varieties here to eat in efficient cost.
This is vegetable noodles and red sauce pasta. They were ok ok in taste but the amount of garlic and vegetable were damn high in the noodles. Talkinh about the pasta, it was not a balanced dish.‚ô•Ô∏è Taste : Ok ok  Ambience : 70/100  Worth : 50/100
Came to knew about this new location in my locality, though should give it a try and yes the place came out to be surprisingly good. Had fried momos and we're just yum, looking forward to try new item next item. Go and have something guys a good place with pocket friendly budget.
Mashaallah food, and that complimentary sweet kheer, that is awesome too. High rated food for high rated guys. Made my dinner special that tandoori chicken and paneer butter masala
Chicken rare amazing and butter chicken awesome. You guys have try anything from yaar anmulle, good food hygiene food, if your food good, your health good
This restaurant food is very bad wrost food quality ever I had in my whole life I would suggest you to everyone never ever order from this dhaba and when I called to that dhaba there attitude was very rude
#delicious #kaathi #kathi #roll and delicious #chinese #food #also #good #place #for #momos #lovers actually i really loved this place and always want to order again
I went there to celebrate one of my friends birthday. Firstly we asked the manager that the food is available or not cos we went there around 4-5 in the evening and most of the restaurant doesn't serve this time, the manager said everything is available. So we ordered dal makhni, tawa chaap, paneer butter masala and tawa roti. Nothing was worth the price. They served us 10 rotis and said we can't serve more because the person who's making rotis is gone. They said this thing when the food is served! These guys just want to earn money by whatever means they can. We asked the manager in first place and he agreed. After this even the manager was no where to be seen!  Pathetic experience!  Not recommended.

Visited this place for brunch last month. It was a perfect setting for winter brunch. They serve the best Asian food and are authentic. The chillis used is actually from the north-east part of India and they do add that extra zing which can only be found in a bhutzolokia chilli. Loved the cocktails and overall ambience. Winter chill and hot Asian food- there is no better combination for sure.
""
This place serves Asian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Momos, Thai cuisines. Went there during evening and spent approximately 4 hours. Really loved this place. It has a wonderful, calm and soothing ambience. It also has a beautiful rooftop seating. Very well done interiors. Owner has really worked hard on the ambience and interiors to make a customer's experience worth it. Went there during the cocktail and wine festival week. This place has a lot of variety of liquor. In starters, tried Spicy Chicken Coriander Dimsums with 3 kinds of dipping sauces namely Black Pepper Soy, Sweet Vinegar Ginger and Coriander Chilli Garlic. Also ordered Chilly Garlic Chicken Skewer. Both the starters were really really good. Then in main course ordered Burnt Garlic Butter Fried Rice (Veg) and Schezwan Chicken with Diced Onion. Both were really really scrumptious. In shakes, ordered Berry Cookie Shake and Oreo Shake which tasted really really good. In desserts, ordered Sesame Chocolate Dumpling and Brownie. Both were really tasty items. Price wise, a bit on a higher side but overall a great dine in and party option. Highly recommended place.

I absolutely love this place.It is pocket friendly and fulfilling your hunger needs. Even though there is a lot of crowd here but they manage to serve you comparatively in a shorter span of time. Garlic bread is one of the highlights of this cafe but you can for sure try their cold coffee and variety of shakes they offer!!
This is a nice place for shakes .. We had kitkat shake and it was anazing .. I loved the crowd and vibrant interior.
No sitting arrangements.

This place is closed now.
The place was very aesthetic, calm and very lively. Food was really impressive. Totally loved the drinks there. Specially the watermelon mocktail. Shakes were amazing. The best was the chilli willy garden pizza and white sauce pasta. Ambience was very aesthetic and really cute. Must try place.
Loved the peacefull and quiet place with good vibes and definately the good food. Surely visting ot soon.Tried the walnut brownie with vanilla icream and it was beyond tasty and delicious. Very tempting and good.

1UP restaurant is one of the prettiest place I have ever been too. I had visited here today, I must say the interior was astonishing there were cute lights and properly arranged sitting area. It also have a bar available. The staff was humble and I must also appreciate the service as it was quick. The place was not that much crowded but all the people who were there were kinda sophisticated. I had ordered:  1. BUTTER CHICKEN PIZZA (it was really tasty , must try it with butter chicken gravy ) 2. CHEESE GARLIC BREAD (average) 3. 2 COLD COFFEE (the amount was good) 4. COKE (usual)  All over the food was great. I really liked it. And I enjoyed being there.
This place serves the best shawarma. I opted for home delivery even then it tasted the best.   The packaging was intact and mayonnaise was being served along.
This is a must visit place for shawarma lovers! I used to frequent this place in my school days. The quality and quantity is really good. I have tried their shawarmas and rolls as well. However the rolls lack consistency. Sometimes they are very good and sometimes they taste totally different.  Hygiene - 3/5  Taste - 4/5  Value for money - 3/5
Many people told me that at this place i can find really nice rolls. I gave it a shot and ordered chicken tikka roll and achari chicken roll. I must say that the quality of chicken wasn‚Äôt up to the mark! The upper crust was good but one has to compromise with the stuffing! It could have been better!
Please avoid ordering from this place. I found some thing non chewable in my shawarma and taking it out from my mouth, I realised that it was PLASTIC. On calling them about the issue, their response was callous and casual. Asked me to report it to Swiggyit to get a refund, while what I really wanted was a sincere apology assuring that the same won't happen again.
Pocket friendly campus hang out spot with really yummy rolls. Though, you'd need to develop a taste for the hygiene and the taste. Weak stomach would mean food poisoning.

I have been to this place several times and never am disappointed with the food and the quality here. This place provides you a number of cuisines and everyone is just so tasty. They have now opened their full course menu so we van relish those dishes as well. I personally Love the Supreme thali from here as well as the pasta. They make these tasty food fresh in front of you which is amazing.
This place is quite famous for kathi rumali and pasta. I tried both of them . The kathi lacked flavours according to my palate. Their mixed pasta was damn good for sure. Its a must try there. One can also try the kathi for once . It looks very very spicy but it isn't spicy at all
One of the best bakery shops in Shalimar Bagh is this place. If you want to have quality food/snacks, then this is just the right place for you. The menu for food here consists of all the north Indian as well as continental and south Indian food. Also the the variety of desserts and cakes is just so worth it. We love the creativity in icing of the cake.

I have tried their much hyped nutri kulcha and malai chaap recently. The service was quick and the food was good too, not worth the hype tho. The kulcha was prepared live in front of us. The gravy served along with it was very spicy and I loved it the most. It has good flavours of the spices being used. The malai chaap was good too. The quantity of both of the items was less as per the price but yes you can try it once. We also took coke bottles and some tandoori rotis along with the chaap. People were enjoying the meal in their cars and they have some seating area available as well.
""

too much spicey and dry malai chaap, instead already instructed less spicey and extra cream on Malai Chaap

This is a very reasonable and quality shop if you are looking for decent Chinese food. We have tried almost every dish of this shop and the Special Noodle and Vegetable Basket is our favorite. They offer tasty food and the packaging and presentation is also very decent.
Must visit...
Awesome food and good hiegene
Very polite, good food, clean environment

It tastes really well but little expensive. Else everything is fine. Pros Hygine Timely orders Location Friendly staff Cons are not too much Expensive
Tried veg noodles and honey chilli potatoes. Food tasted good. Once tried their Spring roll as well. It was amazing. Special mentions for Spring roll. Must try dish. Quantity and quality are satisfyjng. Even the staff and services are good.
I have been going to chitrakut since when I was a kid. The taste of handi paneer and tawa paneer is really good. The kadhai paneer has deteriorated over the past many years. The size of laccha paratha and naan also does not justify its price.
Not suggested as per the food and everything its just hyped ! Overhyped i must say reAlly disappointment
A very bad restaurant donot deliver write item and donot go on rating it is not according to the rating it is fake donot oder from this restaurant
Moongphali is a food outlet located in shalimar bagh. It serves a variety of quick food items. One of them is tex-mex pizza. Its. Very delicious and pricew are very reasonable
I ordered pizza ... pizza was nice due to deliveryboy i cant enjoy it .... he deliverd it cold ... But at this price when u get all veggies ... And taste was also good ....i like it ..
"I ordered cheese burst burger seeing so many good reviews but it came out to be the worst burger I have ever had. Going with the name ""CHEESE BURST"" there is nothing cheesy about this burger. > It just contains a very thin slice of cheese, > Tikki was very basic yet insipid , > Negligible cheesy jalapeno dressing. Alternatively, to give spicy taste they used red chilly sauce üò§, > In the name of veggies it contains only romaine luttuce and onion. No radicchio lettuce as shown in (misleading) picture was there!! Highly disappointed!! Not at all worthy of Rs. 130. Doesn't even use box to pack burger. 1 star is for on-time delivery by zomato"
A nice cafe menu wise, you can try their Maggie, shakes and masala lemonade. Take away or ordering is a better bet as they don't have much area for dining and the market where it is located is full of car workshops.
""
Ordered 5 corn pizzas and I am so disappointed with their quality now. They have Detoriated the quality of their pizzas. There was hardly any cheese in the pizza and toppings were negligible. Rating , Food - 2/5 Service - 3/5
Highly co-operative staff along with tasty food. It is worth going there
Great menu. Farmhouse pizza is delicious. They have different choices of crusts and toppings. Choco Lava Cake is a must try. Stuffed garlic bread is amazing too. The ambiance is decent. The delivery is also on time. They have food in all price ranges.
""
Definitely in need of a thorough makeover. The staff still suffers from a hangover of the bygone era when restaurant business wasn't as evolved and a customer's little requests were not supposed to be communicated to the kitchen. And with service charge, any residual inclination to properly service the table has also died. God forbid, if one has to pay a visit to the washroom.
Food was good, the restaurant has a silent atmosphere ans staff was too cooperative. Butter chicken was the best item must try it, with butter naan
Very poor taste. Try someone else. Don't waste your money. It's not like old times . They need to focus on taste the name is not enough. Poor show.
Very nice dining experience, went for a family dinner with 14 members, greeted with good smile, nice seating area, warm lights.  Ordered chicken rarra, chicken handi, stuffed naan, methi malai matar, daal makhni, paneer lababdaar, handi diwani, pudina parantha, lachaa parantha, butter naan, stuffed naan, besani roti.  Everything was made to perfection with right amount of spices.
Great Ambience!! Amazing Food!! Prices Are Quite Affordable!! Pure Food!! Quality Of Food Is Dam Great!! Love To Visit This Place !!   Ratings-9/10
A small lounge in shalimar bagh that looks quite shady but serves the best food around. From snacks to main course everything was worth trying out. Even the staff was very welcoming.

This lounge is best for having snacks and hukkah. Ambience of this cafe was tempting. Service was very polite. I had ordered one white sauce pasta, one dim sum, 3 coke and 1 hukkah. It was my best experience. I had loved visiting this cafe.

I ordered paneer tikka and spring rolls. Both were fantastic. Quantity of both the items was also good. Paneer was super good. Must try place. Spring rolls were a bit hard so i am deducting 1 star for it.
Excellent food with courteous staff.Nice services provided by pushpa and nayak.
Best place for Chinese and thai food all food items were delicious specially schezwan domain and chilli paneer and the staff was also very courteous . Had great service from pushpa and n itayak

I ordered jr. fried chicken burger meal with dilli 6 fries n iced tea ..  I got Pepsi zero instead of iced tea  The fries were not really spicy n the burger was also very mild in terms of flavours.
Great variety of burgers followed by delicious sides. A good replacement for McDonald's. Prices are also reasonable. Ordered their bk veggie burger and their bk veggie wrap both were good.  Amazing experience.  Highly recommended to all burger lovers.

I ordered 3 plate alloo tikki but the salad ,curd and chutney I get was the same quantity which I get with 2 plate ?Why this happened???
""
Chicken tikka. Here the beauty is the cutting of the chicken which is well mixed with dahi and red masala which gives a wonderful taste. Well served with green chutney and onions.

Came here for a quick lunch last week. Their veg thali was good and the food quantity was good enough to fill you up. The staffs were friendly
I visited kebab express for a quick  lunch and tried north indian meals.  I ordered kadhai paneer meal and butter chicken meal.  The butter chicken was average and a bit too oily for my liking. The kadhai paneer was amazing. The meals were value for money.
Kebab Xpress located in unity one mall near Rohini west metro station. I visited this place with my friend for the first time. I enjoyed the food . I ordered one veg. Biryani and two nimboo water in Beverages. The food was so tasty and service was good. Staff was so polite.

I received cold food with no taste.... shahi panner felt like tomatos only..raita was too sour with hair inside... Naan was like rubber...Think before buying..not worth ordering

This outlet deals more with order delivery. The place is picket friendly. The food was delivered on time.
Butter chicken was just okayish nothing great. üçó Ambience is good and service was okay okay. Honestly was expecting much more..
I visited here on 04.01.2020. I found that they donot take care of hygiene because when we received our food . We found cockroach in that which their kitchen is not safe and clean. When i asked waiter to take out that cockroach, we found another cockroach on our table.

Domino's Pizzas are my favorite. I just love the the most. They are so yummy, cheesey and soft and flavourful. Whenever I have cravings for pizza I always choose the Domino's. And I always go for cheese burst in every pizza because it tastes like heaven.

Most popular and Best in Nangloi for Chole Bhature. Comfortable Sittings and Quality food. Complete Paisa-Vasulü§§. Must Visit Experienceüëå..
Aswesome... Loved this... Place.... Service is good... But main issue is of parking here as no specific parking area alloted... Except this you will love to come this place again and again
Good chowmin and chilly potatoes like there food visit this place for finishing your hunger with in budget loving it be there again best Indian food in good price better than other for Indian dish
Quantity is good enough .........but Worst gravy chaap ever in mah whole lyf, even chaap does not chew easily......... cleanliness good....  Service good......
Worst wah ji wah outlet....i brought a gravy chaap and it was smelling..worst taste worst food...never waste money and time in this restaurant
I love love love their soya chaps. It is awesome and mouth watering. The outlet is not so good as there is problem of sitting area but i order my father to put some food from there because it is just wow.
Facilities Is not genuine but food Is too god you will lick your fingers after eating food of this Rasoi Best dish is Chole and kulche I loved it
Visiting this place from about 10 years, do i need to say anything more.... Every item on menu is good ... I personally like matter sahi and khadai paneer... Budget place with value for money... This placed moved to near reliance store currently..
Amazing dal makhni. Typical road side dhaba with amazing and limited menu right on the main najafgarh road next to reliance fresh. Must try there dal makhni, shahi paneer and messi roti.
very good food nd tasty cleanness in resturant very delicious food and manners staff is also good food soo tasty i willgive 200 stars to the resturant nd zomato please add in
Awsome place in nangloi locality for dine out. There service are good. You will get the best service in nangloi especially in non veg as well as in veg.  Now comes too food, i tried there shahi paneer, taste was great but gravy is little bit sour. Gravy quantity is much good enough for two people in half quantity. In butter roti sometimes you will feel the taste of ‚Äúkoyla‚Äù like thing.   But overall it was a great experience and personally saying if you are a non veg lover must try this place.
Great food, Great Service. Nice Ambience. Ordered food 3-4 times and really loves the taste and experience. Much recommended for a family get together and birthday parties.
Nice place..nice food.. butter chicken ordered at home..it was nice n fresh...must try once..finger licking taste..efficient staff when visited.
Well you won't get surprised when Mr bite serves you a tasty pizza because it is their habit with them so I ordered plzza ect. I'm big fan Mr bite
Wow lovely south Indian dishes more any one is there dosa .itly pizza all dish are there we are served with hot food beautiful shop . Tasty food
The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the special momos,pizza noodles infused with different sauces.The taste was great (Highly Recommend for the people who love Mexicon and Chinese infused with Indian spices).
We tried this 1st tym....n we truly enjoyed their dishes....n we have become there regular customer now....We prefer them all the tym when we r in mood to have....all items r very delicious....We r very thankful to them that now we have this best opportunity snacks shop near by our house......Plz frnds visit once n try....I m dmmn sure that u will be fond of having on regular basis...best of luck Mr. Bite
Sai Durga dosa is in gud located in gud place nice for South Indian food masala dosa is best u can also enjoy Chinese and pizza..... In. budget price range
Excellent food quality and nominal pricing. Dine in space also available.  Try their butter paneer dosa as that is a specialty their. You can also try their pizzas which comes in three sizes and the owner makes them himself. Quite good if you don't wanna empty your wallet in dominoes.  They also have many varieties of burgers and sandwiches available and they too are finger lickin good  Lastly their chowmein is average but not bad but i would prefer their other items over chowmein any day.  Do not go their by car as it is very crowded lane.
It was an extremely pathetic experience at Themis. What i heard i did not experience that at all. Such unhygienic and poorly managed place. 0 rating from my side

The moment you enter, you are pleased by such a good ambiance; A buffet place serves great food with great taste. Starting from the starters till the main course, everything was perfect; not to forget their Welcome Chat and desserts too. We really enjoyed live music performance with live grilling on the table. Loved their services and staff behavior was very friendly. Kudos to their work.
What a beautiful place to be! The ambience of the outdoor seating area is just amazing. The staff is also humble and polite. Talking of the food, we ordered paneer tikka for starters, dal makhni and garlic naan for main course. For dessert, we had gulab jamuns and black forest pastry. The paneer tikka was served on the table in a live tandoor. Nice concept. The dal makhni was flavourful and the naan was also wonderful. Gulab jamuns were so good, totally loved them. The small sized, cute looking black forest pastries were also nice. Overall a great experience.
Went on a lunch yesterday with my family at Themis barbeque which is in NSP.  We had non veg buffet there, barbeque items were amazing and snacks were up to the mark.  There was a great variety in main course as well. Everything was just great.  Desserts had my heart. The hot chocolate brownie was my favourite. Other items were also nice.  We had a great family time there with nice ambience too.
Third class packing last tym i also said about packing but they cant listen they repeat this in my recent order again and lost their customer also
Jalebi taste was good. But little bit cold quantity was okay. Zomato delivery executive service was pretty good.
""
GULAB is surely among the best when it comes to sweets , hygiene and service . The mild instrumental songs playing in the background is really soothing . Everything I have tried at this place is just excellent . Some might find prices to be high but I think they are reasonable as per the service and quality. Finding parking spot near the place gets annoying sometimes .  Recommendations : special matar kulcha , aloo tikki with chhole , pav bhaji , laccha tokri .  Service - 5/5       Hygiene - 5/5       Taste - 5/5      Presentation - 3/5
The staff is sometimes not helpful. There are insects found glued to laddoos and other mithaais at times.

I went this place with one of my best friend.i just enjoyed being there.it was such a best place I have been in nsp. I heard about this place a lot. So it was exciting to being there. We had mix sauce pasta, virgin mojito and Oreo shake. It was all pocket friendly. Firstly i thought that there is self service but no...there staff came ND took a order ND served us warmly. so I guess it was my new spot in Delhi.
Why is that the home delivery orders differ drastically (bad) from what is served when you have it at the outlet itself...and I'm not talking about that food was raw or cold but... it's completely different and low quality with half the ingredients....why can't you serve the same food for online deliveries which you would serve a person who if was at your outlet himself. The picture might be good but it aure was not good in reality...
On a Sunday afternoon, i came here with my friends. We ordered mixed sauce pasta it was so good in taste, quantity was pretty nice, Veg pizza was okay it could be better, hakka noodles they were amazing in taste. DRINKS: we ordered cold coffee and virgin mojito, coffee was so good that we ordered it twice.  TASTE: 4.3/5 QUANTITY: 5/5
Have heard a lot about this place and finally went there to try their famous Punjabi style Pasta and it was delicious... And also ordered Mojito which was also best in taste... And also was not so inexpensive but totally in bugdet... The pasta was more of veggies includes less pasta so that was little disappointing.. Overall A must visit.
It‚Äôs a really nice restaurant to satiate them South Indian cravings !  I for one love South Indian and completely relished the delicacies being served at this place!   Ordered -   Onion Masala Dosa - It was really nice and fresh! Not really spicy. The filling was fresh and adequate ! üëç  Mysore Masala Dosa - A Mysore Dosa can never go wrong! The paste was really nice, not very spicy unlike a lot of Mysore dosas that we find around! üëç  Military Ghee roasted Dosa - They serve this by cutting it into 4 pieces ! Each piece is very heavy since it is loaded with a lot of ghee ! Super yum! üëç  Sizzling brownie with ice cream - üòçüëç  Over all, this place is a must visit especially if you are a crazy South Indian lover! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Sankalp is a leading South Indian nourishment eatery network in India and has its spread in more than 7 nations.   I am an irritable foodie as well as somewhat harder than that.   With regards to South Indian nourishment I become quite certain as some place you don't get great Sambar, some place the idlis or some more.   Here at Sankalp I was extremely eager to go and I enjoyed it too however all comes to one point that is the nourishment which was fine according to me and not so incredible.   Actually abhorred the way that the nourishment was served on a stale leaf .   Love the inviting however with scrumptious rasam yet the masala idlis were bad and the dosa was extremely soggy .   Two things that I adored in a South Indian nourishment restaurant  was Chilly garlic noodles and sizzling chocolate brownie.   Accommodation was truly normal as I didn't feel great around their staffs too .   Won't suggest Sankalp Pitampura .
We went to Sankaslp Pitampura on 15th Jan with great expectations. But the experience was very bad. We were a group of 9 .We tried Fried idlies, dahi bhallas,french fries in starters . Dahi bhalla was not at all tasty. Fried idly was also not good. In main course we tried Mysore dosa. The potato bhaji inside the dosa was very cold.The service was delayed although there were only 1-2 more groups in the restaurent at that time. In sweets we had kesari halwa and payasam. Halwa was good but not good compared to that at SagarRatna. Payasam was not tasty. decor was ok. Although that at Sankalp Punjabi Bagh is much better.¬† And the horrible part is that at least 4 of us got stomach upset/stomach ache the next day.
Sushi is my all-time favourite and this time its veg sushi roll ,this outlet has good and huge variety of sushi‚Äôs and Japanese delicacies, tried their veg sushi roll , it was soft and smooth and just meted in the mouth , the wasabi dip has authentic flavours and going well with the Sushi. I really loved veg sushi roll and will surely try some more delicacies from this place. 5/5
Great ambiance. A place to get into a cool conversation with friends The prices are reasonable.best place to eat
I ordered 3 crispy veg burgers at midnight. The burgers were simple nothing fancy yet delicious. Perfect food for your late night cravings

Recently visited this outlet which is at nsp . The ambience and service was great . They have great variety of burgers.I ordered paneer king melt and chilli cheese burger and cheesy fries. The taste was amazingg , the quality of the food was also good . This place is must try .
I ordered 2 days ago and didn't get my fries and when i call back the delievery boy he said he recieved it like this, and nobody was picking up call in buger king n im very upset with this
Slow service
I hv ordered  garlic bread nd classic nachos . Worst taste ever i tried . Waste of money to come here . Very bad experience . I would never recommend to others to come here
Tried their Blueberry Shake, Kitkat Freak Shake, Pizza and Dirty Burger!  Kitkat Shake was good, Pizza was the best among all, Blueberry shake was ok to try and the Dirty Burger was literally tasteless.  I took out nachos from the burger and later I realised that the only thing that have some taste in burger was the nachosüòÇ

A good,but small place for your college gang :) For more information, check out my insta handle : @blessyour_feed ‚ú®
Always delight to visit this place, great taste , great food evening is great about this place. I ordered my favourite Aloo tikki and bhalla papri, Aloo tikki was very crispy and delicious and bhalla papri was also very good in taste of quality and taste. Staff is also very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended....!

I ordered gol gappas for home, all the gol gappe was cracked and the quantity of paani was insanely less. I complained for this but didnt got expected response

Best indian veg food that you can‚Äôt find anywhere. The two of my favourite dishes are it‚Äôs crispy aloo Tikki and Pav bhaji that is evergreen. It has many outlets in delhi, do try whenever you get a chance to.

Felt amazing there by their service and food quality also the staff behavior was just so good and friendly environment was very good and food taste just mouthwatering Loved the snacks specially prawns and chicken tikka. Desserts was so good and tasty main course also amazing spices amd taste was just upto the mark. Kudos to their work and staff specially.
Must say the staff is amazing and so is food, they are too good and know how to attend a customer and everything From interaction to timings everything is perfect ‚ù§ food is way too good from starters to maincourse, main course to dessers‚ù§
Staff was really nice chef Muzammil, Mr vinod Mehra and Mr. Ram served us really well.  Everyone has a smile on their face to make our time pleasant

The fries were supper yum.... üòÜ The platter is good enough for two people though it is possible to eat almost of it by yourself tooü§≠. It had a burger which was okayish..... The garlic bread was nice and so were the brownie fudge and sandwich.. the only thing that was just fine and not that good was the pasta...üôÇ
This super cool place in NSP serves delicious food at an affordable price.  I tried their tandoori garlic bread and stuffed garlic bread.  Their tandoori garlic bread is something which you should definitely try. It‚Äôs super yum.  The stuffed garlic bread tastes good too. Apart from their garlic bread, you can also try their Pastas, Shakes, Maggi, and Sandwiches.

One of my friend recommended me of their tasty foods so i decided to give it a try. I ordered baked white sauce pasta, when it came it was looking delicious and moreover when we tasted it, it was super awesome as the pasta was so creamy and they had a bread also which was also yummy with pasta, i will recommend you to give a try. @delhisocial
Good food and excellent service by Hussain.all staff are polite lovely location nsp
Thanks for an excellent service by Silvia, Vikram and Neeraj
we had buffet and food was really good. salad ...lalla mussa dal and makhanwala paneer is too much.. as well as service also very nice... lovely place for dining. Mr HUSSAIN he was great server.....
Thank you Hussain for the attentive service üòÄ
Good food and excellent service by Mr Hussain
There are almost 350 varieties of egg options here , taste is too good to please the taste buds . Price is average ..
I ordered 2 jalandhari. One item was well. Other was so overly cooked that i throwed. And no one saw my instructions for anything. Least bothered for clients.
I visited here last night with my friends and we ordered 3 items and everything was not upto the mark. All of that tasted bad. We were not really satisfied by the taste.
Amazing food available here. Insane type of variety plus good quality. Highly recommended. Best thing is no dish any sort of smell of an egg(for people who doesnt like smell of an egg)
I never imagined omlettes to taste so amazing before going to this place. Love their tandoori jalandhri and chicken jalandhri omlette. The only drawback is the hygiene factor. Otherwise the omlettes are so sooo good. They have a huge variety of omlettes. Definetly a place to tryüôå

Echoes has a beautiful concept which is run by a bunch of differently able people. I have been to Echoes Satyaniketan before and I was super excited to visit their new outlet in GTB. This place is completely different from the one I visited before. It is beautifully designed, be it that graffiti on the wall or the overall interior.¬† There is a switch to turn on and off the lights above every seating. Switch it on and the staff member would come to take the order. Each and every item in the menu card has a code which one can write on the order sheet and hand it over to them to place the order. If someone need to understand anything, they can definitely call the Manager and talk to him normally.¬† If I talk about food. It was an absolute bliss. We ordered for -¬† - The 5KG thali which had everything from butter chicken, dal makhni, steamed momos, peri peri fries and what not. Its a must try. I really loved the chicken they serve. - Chicken momos has adequate amount of filling and were real good.¬† - The dessert platter which was heavenly. It had rainbow pastry, brownie, choco bar with vanilla ice cream. Coming to their shakes, this place serves the best shakes in GTB.¬† I tried chocolate shake, red velvet shake and strawberry shake and these all were to die for.  Undoubtedly, the best place in GTB to have good food and drinks. Definitely going to visit them again.

Well the question is why the Echoes? So let me make it clear with a few points * well what's the most important is the food and trully Echoes have made their name in the world of food for their taste already and they haven't dissappointed me at all on my visit. *the dine in experience here is really pleasant for which I am glad that they do have this amazing coordination with kitchen and the serving staff. And well the music that rolls you up is even there so what really you are waiting for? Thanks echoes.
Ordered panner tikka and Hawaiian chicken. And it was delicious and tasty. The paneer tikka was nice and awesome. The Pizza is well presented and have nice amount of cheese and toppings. The delivery was on time and packing was good.
Delivery time was good food was enough to have lunch with friends and food is very tasty in rows there are cream cream is much then other roles you can enjoy your meal each meal and you can enjoy roles and chicken rolls are tasty but veg rolls are more tasty Paneer rolls it is the best role I have ever eaten in my life
This restaurant was one of the best restaurant restaurant in our locality. We ordered from here in several times. We ordered from here chicken wings and chicken salt and paper. Chicken wings was too much smooth and delicious assorted with several spices. Chicken salt and paper was flavourful and chicken was soft. Food :5/5 Food presentation :5/5 Delivery :5/5 Delivery timing was great. We strongly recommend the place.
I ordered platters from this place today, Chinese platter and pepri platter. Both were extremely delicious. I loved the food quality and it's taste. Delivery was on time and food packaging was good. Highly recommended.
Somedays back , i ordered from this outlet which is near to Delhi University , GTB Nagar. This restaurant delievers some amazing and varieties of dishes . I tried Kadhai paneer tikka and Hot Garlic fried rice quality as well as Quantity of the items were perfect. As instructed they Maintained perfect level of spice in panner tikka. Packaging was good as well. I would definitely order again from here and will try some of their incredible dishes .
This place is love i found it very Amazing because of the Taste of the food & the platters which are served over here. The best thing that i loved about this place is waffles & its Pasta
The place is decent. I liked the taste of the food. We ordered a veg platter and two shakes. The staff is very polite and helpful. It was worth spending money on. The food is delicious and I like the variety. It's affordable. Good place to hang out with friends and family.
The place is amazing. I've been visiting here since my college days. Though I miss the rooftop sitting but it still is great. I like the new menu more..  I loved the herbivores platter. Would have been even better had it been served hot.
So here is my review for this place- 1.Ambience is great and the place is too much crowded specially on weekends. You have to wait to get a reservation. 2.Food is amazing. We ordered singapuri noodles and chilly paneer and they were bomb. Although quantity of chilly paneer was less as per the price. 3.It is at the walking distance from the metro station.  In all my experience was great and i loved this cozy, little, crowded yet yumm food place. üòç  Follow @tuck_into_food for more reviews and posts on #instagram & #facebook and now at #zomato too. üòäüòä
It's always a best place for me & recommend to students , couples, freinds and your loved ones. There food is mouth watering .

Excellent environment, friendly services l, great menu choice and really decent food and at affordable prices. Will be back

A beautiful place with a beautiful ambience and with the very great food. I had a whole wheat veg basil pasta which was toooo creamy and delicious , pizza hat burger was quite big as I found it difficult to figure it out how to take a biteüòÖ and tiramisu jar was also bang on! All over I loved that place and their hospitality as well :)
Big yellow door serves the Italian food so rich in flavors, that just starts watering your mouth just by reading the menu.You can't go wrong with this restaurant and that too with affordable prices.It is really easily accessible location for du students .You should definitely give it a try
A good place for foodies. Ambience was good but a bit slower service speed. Food was upto the mark and presentation was also good. Overall a good experience
I mostly order special egg thali which includes egg curry dal rice and roti totally satisfied with the taste and impressed with the packaging of food they take care of hygiene very well
Been regularly ordering rajma rice and chicken curry combos... I can vouch for their rajma that it will not fail to remind you of home. Oh the favours ! They know how to prepare rajma, thankfully not everyone can master the mystic art of making the perfect tasty drooling rajma rice.  Pocket friendly as their target audience was mainly students, since their siblings branch is based on the heart of Delhi university, they offer an array of cuisines, from Indian to Chinese, sea food, and a plethora of snacks at a very much student friendly budget, so it won't hurt pockets at all. Plus you don't compromise on the taste.  Though the food can be oily at times so you can call the restaurant and an them to do the needful. Health fanatics can guilt free cheat here once in a while to get the taste.  I have tried their chicken 65, BBQ chicken, rajma rice, chicken curry roti combo, butter chicken combo, kadai paneer roti combo, to name a few.  This review comes after hogging food from this restaurant for the past few months now.  Will be ordering more. . . Will recommend this place to everyone to try it at least once
I have ordered pasta and Tandoori Malai momos Pasta sauce was good but there were too much vegetables in it. Tandoori Malai momos were good but not that savory.
Late delivery. Did not like the food at all. I ordered a thali from their place. Was not worth it. The dal makhni was not good. Nor the shahi paneer. The chapatis were dry.
Ordered 1 LIIT cocktail and 1 30ml red label whisky. Ratings---> Ambience-4/5 Beverages-4/5 Music-4/5 Rooftop-4/5  Overall, a nice place to sit and relax.
Yesterday I went to 736 located at Hudson lane.. excellent restraunt... hospitality was amazing...they served good food and very delecious..I ordered Chicken burger Paneer tikka Kabab Butter chicken pizza Shakes Veg platter... All were yummy and delecious.. thanks for good hospitality.
Few days back I visited this restro which had ancient style decor. I was really impressed with the decor and vibrant ambience. In starters I had achari paneer tikka which was spicy and delicious. I got to try dahi ke sholey and they were really soft and yummy. In veg platter too I tasted some great starters including tandoori aloo, mushroom and paneer tikka. Then I tried paneer tikka pizza which was one of the best pizzas, with crispy crust and paneer cubes and veggies as toppings. I tried the cocoa rust shake and it was refreshing. Would love to visit this place again soon!
Today i visit 736 AD in Vijay Nagar   It's theme is very attractive and beautiful.  I tried fish finger, Chicken overloaded pizza and chicken lollipop.  Chicken lollipop was very good in taste like mouth watering  In main course i tried kadai chicken with butter naan it was amazing combo   Last but not least i tried brownie with ice cream.  Everything was amazing and service was really very amazing.   I recommend you to definitely visit there
We went to 736 AD yesterday for a friend's birthday party and had a lot of fun there. We were a group of 6 and sat at the rooftop area as the other two floors were a little too cramped and noisy for our liking. We ordered many starters including the cheese garlic bread, chicken bruschetta, corn and cheese nuggets, honey chilli potato & classic chilli chicken. Out of these we loved the chicken bruschetta and corn and cheese nuggets the best and definitely will suggest them. Next we ordered the chicken steak sizzler and paneer tikka and an array of drinks to satiate our throats. While the paneer tikka tasted as one would ideally expect it to taste, the chicken steak came in a gravy sauce with a side of rice which was a surprise and not a pleasant one. On the other hand we also ordered 3 mocktails (Blue Lagoon, Water melon Tesco & Pina colado) out of which the Pina colado tasted the best! Apart from these we had also ordered a few shakes but none of them seemed exceptional. For main course we ordered a white sauce pasta and two pizzas (one veg one n. veg) all of which were decent. The pasta was not upto the mark in terms of taste and definitely could have been better while the pizzas (Smoky Chicken and Garden Veggie) both had very hard crusts but tasted well. Overall we had a nice experience at the restaurant and will definitely suggest the place for a nice hangout with friends!
The Taste of the food over here is highly recommend with good presenting style ‚ù£Ô∏è. The best thing i like about this place is the swing which is there üòé

Looking for amazing good then your wait is over. The spezia bistro cafe in Hudson lane offers extraordinary food. The aura of this place is very good plus the lighting and the infrastructure is purely magical. On the staff recommendation ordered Their CHEESE BURST PIZZA which So cheesy and delicious, a must try!  The PEACH BLUEBERRY MOJITO was very creative and unique both in taste and presentation and the strawberry and chocolate shake won my heart the flavours were amazing. also tried their PERI PERI CHICKEN served with rice and some saute vegetables. It is a good option for lunch but it will not satisfy the hunger of one person as the quantity of food was way too less.  Heard a lot about their dessert but Won't be able to ordered it because of lack of time but will visit this place again for the dessert specially!!‚ù§Ô∏è
A small cafe with really good and cooperative staff! Food was nice! Cheeze wheel pasta is a must try. Lasagna was good too. I loved it. Food: 09/10 Ambience: 09/10 Service: 100/10 Staff: 10/10
This place was bookmarked a long ago by me and finally I got to visit this place and I am really glad I did From the lively environment to delectable food it was all phenomenal I'll definitely recommend this place for a pacifying meal.
""
The place is amazing in terms of quality, taste and price. I ordered chicken lasagne, cheese garlic bread, berrymix drink, chocolate shake and cheese sticks. The lasagne, garlic bread and chocolate shake was nice. Won't recommend the cheese sticks and berry mix drink. I am looking forward to visit again and try other Veg. Options. A little hesitant towards trying non-veg as they also serve pork and I am not sure whether they use different utensils to cook pork and chicken/fish.
Hiya foodies  Went to this cafe today and it was just lovely‚ò∫Ô∏è The ambiance was nice and the food was also very tasty ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è I ordered-  White sauce pasta Cafe and tiramisu shake  German chocolate shake  Summer berry hawaian rico tea Paneer Tikka and paprika pizza   I just loved everything ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è Do visit ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

Mutton mughlai had only bones no meat and biryani was so cold again with minimum amount of chicken.. Staff started arguing when complained. Please visit some other place. The name us big but food has no quality here .
My first visit to Karim‚Äôs but surely not the last. Have got food delivered to home from the branch in south delhi multiple times but going to the original Jama Mazjid one was a revelation of sorts. Had the most amazing food, whatever we ordered was delicious to the last bite. It was a complete gastronomic experience..   We ordered the Seekh kebabs, mutton korma, mutton stew, n kheema with khameeri rotis. Each and every dish was out of the world.  The sheekh were so moist n bursting with flavours. Have not had better sheekh kebabs in a long time.  The mutton korma was unbelievably tasty. Loved every bite of it.  Khameeri roti was outstanding. Goes do well with this type of food.  Kheema was delicious. A bit too much of oil that we had to remove but outstanding it was.  Didn‚Äôt like the mutton stew much.   It was a magical evening. Loved the experience of going to Jama Mazjid. Though I grew up there but haven‚Äôt got a chance to visit in almost 4 decades.
Aaj ka #dinner famous JAMA masjid wale #karims ka #chicken. #chickentikka #tandoorichicken #rumaliroti . They really really serves the one of the best chicken in delhi. I can eat there chicken anything any day. Karims ka chicken nai khaya toh kya hi khaya‚ù§üòç
Went there with a friend a couple of days ago. Had to wait 30 minutes to get a seat as it's always full. We ordered chicken seekh, mutton seekh in the starters. Both were delicious especially mutton seekh. After that we ordered mutton korma and rumali roti. The mutton korma was without a doubt the highlight of our lunch. We enjoyed the food so much that we didn't even bother to click pictures üòú. Will come here again sometime in the future and try their biryani as well. Highly recommended

The best chicken rostered i ever had. The chicken was roasted in amul butter and gravy was made by amul cream.
The most amazing chicken experience on can hope for! Smoky, juicy and full of flavor. The no-fuss butter drenched chicken is your dining obligation to this restaurant! Can be had with or without rumali roti

Went to this super famous Aslam to have their legendary butter chicken. Could not stop licking my fingers! This place is the best for all non vegetarians. Its butter chicken is made out of just butter and chicken. My mouth is still watering thinking of the food I had there! Most recommended out of my Delhi trip.

Ladies and Gentlemen, prepare yourself to dine with the history and indulge in some of the best mughlai food you have ever eaten.  A lot has been written about this iconic mughlai restaurant, operational post Independence and it has been said that it was inaugurated by the first Prime Minister of India, Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru and hence the name.  Just go with anything on the menu and you will remember the dish for quite some time, they are so good at it. They have big sitting space and the best part they start serving Nihari from as early as 7 in the morning.  Must haves: Badam Pasande, Nihari, Mutton Korma, Sheermal, Seekh Kebabs  Quality: 4 Quantity: 4 Taste: 4 Price: 4 Ambiance: 3

Stopped here to fill our hungry tummy but wasn't impressed much...Ordered Tandoori chicken , chicken biryani and tandoori roti...Taste of each one was very average and there wasn't any wow element...Prices were a bit high as compared to taste and portion served..

Today I am going to share with you all my real experience with this restaurant. I visit this resturant last year in Delhi NCR. There are no special facilities available in this restaurant. There is a lot of taste in this restaurant‚Äôs food presentation and food content. And there is a lot of nutritious ingredients and vitamins in this restaurant‚Äôs food items. Sometimes the food products sought by the customers are not available here. Because of which customers and guests do not like to come here. The ambience of this hotel is not conducive to customers and guests at all.  There is a lot of decorative and cleanliness in this restaurant, there is plenty of garbage around this restaurant. Due to the abundance of resources, there is a lot of pollution around this restaurant, which makes customers feel suffocated in this restaurant. This restaurant does not offer any special service to customers.  This is why customers are less attracted to this restaurant. In this restaurant, the customers are not provided food according to their taste. Money keeps the value of this restaurant in the restaurant, but if you look at it according to food, then this money is very demanding. Which makes a lot of money waste. And there is no value of money too. Keeping all these things in mind, I urge all the people to never go to such restaurants
Hello my all dear friends today I am share my persinol exprince about a restaurant.it is name is Kake Di Hatti, it is located is Chandni chownk Delhi NCR.it is full on air conditioned and it is pure veg restauant.it is cuisines is north indian.It is payment method is cash and cards accepted, it is restaurant poppuler dishes is dal makhani and lauki raita.Kake Di Hatti Is most poppuler in all delhi.that is all in very fair price and costumer services is very good.i hope you will love it whan you try it.

This is one of the famous place in chandani chow for chole bhature so visited here last weekend with family.¬† They have good variety of north Indian dish. Bhature was excellent but chole i find average in taste.
Visited this place as had heard enough about the famous faluda. This is the heart of Delhi and literally vvv crowdy. I didn't genuinely like the taste of faluda. It was tooo creamy and tooo authentic may be. Otherwise it can be a good option for rabri and malai lovers and all.
Nice place for food and spend time with friends and family ...
Giani‚Äôs di Hatti is famous for there rabri faluda. it is super delicious faluda full of dry fruits and rabri

I went there with my friend on of my friends was live there nearby qureshi kabab shop thy told me that this shop sell best chicken seekh kabab in delhi so i tried the kabab very delicious and mouth watering taste and soft kabab i ever had.

Dahi bhalla and crispy alloo tikki both are my favourite.this shop is very old.they serve fresh food and they made in Desi ghee.too much crowded place.they never packed one plate of Tikki and bhalla.this little bit disappointed.
""
""
This place is famous for Dahi Bhalle. Every time I go to Chandni Chowk, it is fixed that I have to eat dahi bhalle at this place. But now I feel they have lost their old taste. I remember 2-3 years back this was a very small shop and had mind blowing dahi bhallas and alloo tikkis but now they also have a restaurant on the first floor. I feel they have somehow lost their taste and quality.
Thought to gave this place a try for there infamous stuffed kulfi . Also Winters are incomplete without some ice cream or kulfi. So i recently visited this place and tried their Anar Kulfi. The concept is really nice. The kulfi wasn't too sweet and it was balancing the flavours. Taste - 4/5 but i think its a little expensive. Otherwise one should try it atleast once
""
I was absolutely in love with this anar stuffed kulfi.‚ù§Ô∏è It was super refreshing and delicious.
the best rabri kulfi you'll get to eat. So tasty with full of flavour of pista and rabri. You must try it out. You can find in the streets of Chandni chowk.

Some quotes are true old is gold. One of the oldest sweet street junction  Serve hot for eating and cold jalebi's for take away. Not expected high as it was available in chandani chowk street but still was trying to maintain our name and food quality. Love the puree ghee fried jalebi,tried to fullfill every customer tongue.  But still love the way his staff cook in front of us.  It's very near to red fort.
This is a famous shop of Chandni chowk where you can get yummy Jalebis. I ordered Jalebi with Rabri which was extremely yummy but according to me it was little costly...Price:Rs 75/-(Jalebi with Rabri). You can go and try this..
Nice crispy jalebis made up of desi ghee. Perfect sweetness. A must try
Some quotes are true old is gold. One of the oldest sweet street junction Starting price: 50 rs/100 gm Serve hot for eating and cold jalebi's for take away. Not expected high as it was available in chandani chowk street but still was trying to maintain our name and food quality. Love the puree ghee fried jalebi,tried to fullfill every customer tongue.  But still love the way his staff cook in front of us. Salute the hard work. It's very near to red fort so guys don't forget to visit red fort too.                       
Old famous jalebi wala : jalebis are good . We had jalebi with rabri which is a nice combo ‚ù§Ô∏è Jalebis are big,yummy and i love that .
Well, we all know by now that this place serves the best pastas and desserts!! the nepolitana with cheese and mushroom panini made my day. Go try. Don‚Äôt forget the cheesecake and banoffee pie
Penne with vodka veg is a must try. This dish is so fulfilling. It is the thick sauce that is the key ingredient. The bread could be more crunchy. In desert I recommend you try this strawberry frozen yogurt. It has such a refrshing taste, low in fat and quite different from conventional soft serve and ice milk. Enjoy ;)

The best ceasars salad in the country.

Food is the best here . But order might take long . Otherwise it is worth going n having food there . Veg n non veg both are great here
Tastometre ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Service‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Ambience ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê(tables are arranged too close, making it feel a big family hall) Value for money‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  5 star for butter chicken, but 3 for kadhai paneer. Breads again take 5 stars- perfectly crunched and crispy without being burnt. But it's done crispy on request.
This place is my favorite since the past few years fpr north indian cuisine. The quality of food has remained constant, high-class, and really amazing. Went there to try their amazing Butter chicken, we had 1 1/2 portions of it, also tried out the garlic cheese naan, butter roti. Their mutton gullouti kebab were super soft and were to die for ‚ô•Ô∏è  P.S This place has had issues with waiting lines since so long i can't even remember, as they haven't expanded yet, also the prices of dishes have also increased significantly üòî

The ambience is beautiful with lovely aesthetics. We ordered Mahabaleshwar Corn Pattice which is a basically mashed potatoes corn stuffed cutlet and Bhapa Doi Cheesecake with a twist made of yoghurt. Both the dishes tasted very good and best part about the Pattice was it's green chutney which had a rich taste. Cheesecake was unique and very tasty, a must try. Just the place is a little overpriced. Else it deserves all praises.
Cafe Lota is remarkably a gorgeous place to go to and we got even luckier as we visited on cloudy afternoon.  The ambiance and service at this place is great.  We ordered Palak patta chaat, Coffee, Bhapa Doi cheese cake and Bombay Keema bao.¬†  We loved the food. Great Experience.
Nice place. Had railway masala omlette sandwich, which was quite good. Also had sabudana vada.. it was a normal thibg but the green chilli was actually very good. Cold coffee was of particularly my typ (the strong one). Found it a bit overpriced but when you get a good meal , it can be overlooked. Overall quiet place, decent crowds. Truly a morning place.

Best breakfast place !! Yummy pancakes and hash browns ü•ûü§é
If a customers orders medium rare steak and gets it well done, they‚Äôre not coming back. Other things were ok. Nothing worth writing home about.
Italian cuisine has been really a spread over the years in the food industry . The tasteful culture has been undoubtedly kept by Smoke House Deli which offers cuisines from all over the world with pure and authentic flavours . This click contains Penne in Cheesy Alfredo with mushrooms , a pasta side so smooth and creamy that it makes you drool over the dish . Just when you think of something with a contrasting texture , the crispy , well toasted garlic bread serves it's purpose . This combination is perfect to one who wants to enjoy a nice Italian meal . The Blueberry Smoothie in the above frame surely sums up the Italian extravaganza with berries so fresh and the thick texture makes it even more delicious . Catch these amazing items who get an overall rating of a perfect 10 üåü at Smoke House Deli , Connaught Place starting from üí∏Rs. 270/-

For Saturday lunch , i visited Smokey's khan Market. I ordered for a pizza, burger and jalapeno peppers. The food and the ambience both are very good. The jalapeno poppers were the awesome.  But the best of all was orange fresh beer. It was something I'll be going for again very soon.üòã
""
Finally I found a steakhouse in Delhi that lives up to the expectations. If you‚Äôre a fan of steak (not sizzlers) and I mean real steak (and not anything to do with fake ones made with chicken) this is definitely a place you‚Äôll like.

Bery very good place for family and fine dining even if you are with friends or anyone. I feel it is little over priced but the taste they serve is all worth having.

We went to Big Chill for a dinner on Sunday. There was a waiting of 15 minutes and finally we got a seat. The place was loud and noisy which it always is.   The service was quick and waiters were polite.  We had- ‚Ä¢ Pineapple and orange juice- Refreshing   ‚Ä¢ Choco superfudge Shake- Hard to drink as it was extremely thick.  ‚Ä¢ Brotchen pizza roll veg- Good  ‚Ä¢ Ravioli Napoletana- Tasty   ‚Ä¢ Vodka prawn pasta- Very saucy and flavourful.   ‚Ä¢ Chicken florentine- Delicious   ‚Ä¢ New York cheesecake- It wasn‚Äôt set properly, was melting when it got served.  Overall a good experience. The food was tasty as usual.

This is a nice place and definitely its high on price side but worth spending.¬†Well decorated and nice ambiance. Veg Sandwich was delicious with the¬† dipping sauce. And coffee was awesome and well brewed. Love it.
A wonderful winter evening with friends. Loved everything - the vibes, the food, the wine - terrific! Loved the braised oyster mushroom on kale - fresh, flavourful and really really delish! The gnocchi with roasted garlic was beautifully done as well, with soft, pillows of potato gnocchi and light, authentic flavours. Absolutely enjoyed the wines we tried. Good Bordeaux went swell with the food. This is a top spot, folks!
Perch Wine & Coffee Bar, visited this place with my friends, it a nice place with good interiors, food is also decent, i have tried coffee sangaria and cheese pasta, both are amazing in taste.must try this place.
This place is really awesome in terms of taste and service. Really love the way they serve. Best place to have some quality time with family and friends. A must try. Recommendations - 9/10

Ordered Italian style lasagna, Qd's veg tandoori momos, Classic mojito, loaded nachos, Kala khatta and mint sparkler, Belgian chocolate waffle and crispy loaded potatoes. The food is very tasty and affordable at the same time.
This place is famous for their tandoori momos and i love their afgani momos.. they were properly cooked and well in taste as well as their Chinese combo was also very good.. had an amazing experience over there

The only thing good about the place is the ambience nothing else. Items are insanely high priced and even after starters being priced at 1000 rupees one expects the price to be inclusive of taxes but that was'nt so and costed 1400 to 1500. After paying such an exorbitant amount the portions were very very tiny. Coming to the taste I think the cuisine caters more to the Foreigners than the Indian Pallet. Like the signature Blue Cheese Naan Blue Cheese is bitter in taste and I don't think that made sense stuffing it in a naan. Also serving it to customers first up just ruins the taste of your mouth making it bitter. It might be good for someone having it with Wine but definitely not something to start your meal with. The other dishes were also the same story small portions weird taste by mixing too many foreign ingredients and taking away the original taste. In all a place one must not visit

We went for our research group outing to BBQ Nation. We had one fine non-veg lunch here, we even got a special offer as we have come as a large group.¬† The ambiance of the place was good & the service was fast.

Fantastic staff, great food, cozy ambience.. all in all, a dinner date at this restaurant proved to be the perfect wrap to year 2019. A special note of thanks for Satpal who managed our table and made us feel much at home. Three cheers for the Barbeque Nation family! Keep up the good work. Thanks. Wish you all a fabulous year ahead.
Extremely delighted by the services of MR Vishal Verma
it is a cute enlighted place where you can have spend some quality time with your loved ones quite a cozy atmosphere which makes you feel invited here do try their cheese cake shake with cheese omelette

Ordered 6-piece boneless. Got 2 pieces of chicken and overpaid. I contacted the restaurant and they called me a liar and refused to correct the issue. Here is a picture of my order and what I received. Poor service. Just admit you made a mistake. I will not be coming back and will not be recommending you to anyone else as you cannot honor your customers.

There was no salt in the entire meal. Chicken pieces were raw and tasteless. Beans tasted as if someone had taken out them halfway through cooking them. Rice was also uncooked. The worst meal I had for a while. Expensive pricing only adds to the terrible experience. Only giving two stars instead of one because there was no cockroach in the rice. Don‚Äôt order from here or at least this item.
Best healthy food options tasted & highly recommended... Keep up the good work üëç
Amazing Experience with the food.
I went here to eat with my friends yesterday. I was amazed by the service they provided. I ordered Air fried paneer with garlic mash. The food was very healthy and fresh as well. I really enjoyed the food.  The ambience of the cafe was also very nice. The service provided by the employees was amazing. Would definitely recommend visiting this cafe

Amazing food then do go to this place. Service is amazing and food is great. The food is delicious and really amazing. Do try out this place.

This place is synonemous with delicious shawarmas. They make juicy shawarmas having a generous amount of filling. They also serve very tasty momos. Make sure you include mayonnaise in your online order because they won't send it otherwise.

"Morning meals are not normally everyone's sort and individuals in Delhi for the most part go out for early lunch.   However, changing the dreary routine is rarely terrible, isn't that so?   The all American diner is a spot which has been on my ""go to this spot list"" since for eternity. What's more, I am in reality glad that I at last made it on Republic Day as I suspected it is perfect to visit a social environment, yes that is the place it is located!   The cafe has a retro American theme simply like you may have found in some American films or series, it's a similar vibe all through.   The arrangement in faux leather in red and the Wurlitzer jukebox playing a few works of art just helps me to remember some extremely old American motion picture.   You can settle on the Buffet breakfast or you can go for ala-carte..   The spot is perfect in case you're in the state of mind for shakes, burgers, pancakes and waffles.   This is what I requested,   Cappuccino, wicked shake, fruit salad, Belgium waffle and a spicy cheese toast.   Completely infatuated with the waffles, much the same as I needed progressively golden and crispier! Furthermore, the shake was fantastically astonishing .   Cappuccino was actually how I requested that they get . Ultimately, the hot cheese toast was so solid and steady. I could detect enhances in those little bits of toast so superbly!"
""
""
This place had been on my list since forever. And I'm so glad I woke up early morning to reach All American Diner on time for a crazy breakfast spread. It's unbelievably awesome. I ordered Pierre's French toast combo and rock n roll Cappuccino. The quantity, quality and service is outstanding. You cannot miss this when in Delhi.
Must visit!  This place has such a great vibe! The ambience is fun, quirky and young. There many tables in a small place but so well placed that noone intrudes on your space.  The wait staff is very well informed, and can really help you choose with nice suggestions. The service took just the right time. We tried the fried potato, Khow suey - top notch  Absolutely delightful place !

Had a lovely lunch today at Pings. Fab ambience & courteous staff. The food was fabulous, except the Tom Kha soup, which albeit tasty was a little cold. That‚Äôs why the 4 stars. All in all, a fun afternoon at this hidden gem in Lodhi Colony Market.
Best Asian food in Delhi. Their dim sums, baos, mapo tofu etc were to die for. I felt like I had traveled to Thailand, it was that good!!!!!
Best chinese restaurant in Delhi with the best dim sum menu I have ever seen. All the food was bursting with flavour. I for one will be coming back here very often!
""

Best regional Indian food with a huge menu that covers dishes from areas like Kashmir, Bengal along with Rajasthani, Chettinad, NWF, etc. Bold and amazing flavours!
The most authentic Indian fare you can get. Their appams and stew, mutton ghee roast, butter chicken are all to die for. I will be coming back very often.
Defence bakery is the Worst bakery I have ever seen in my life their quality is so bad . Even they have not worried about there customer at all . I personally visit their bakery to complain about my daughter first birthday cake but they have not value my words and feeling . But just said their make the cake like this only . Guys the cake a too much sweet and not even free .
If someone has been waiting for 5-6 minutes, you‚Äôre supposed to bill their order first regardless of how much of a hurry the other person is in. Basic principle of management which you can‚Äôt follow.
One of the most iconic bakeries of Defence Colony. Great variety of desserts and some great savoury puffs.  Must try their vanilla tea cake!
The best Red Velvet cake in Delhi. My friends and family always order my birthday cake from here. The cream cheese is fresh and the taste is inexplicable. Just that their red velvet is getting costlier with every passing day.
Pathetic experience with this brand... I bought a cake black forest for my mom'd birthday today 16 sep 2019 and the cake was sour! Was not fresh and the cake got a smell in it! Never visit again .. never expected this quality from this place

Kent is my forever favorite for quick bite my favorite is chicken burger combo and masla fries. I also like veg sandwich and veg pizza üòã One should definitely try it for quick bite it's totally worth it üòâ
Came here today tried panner tikka roll it was very tasty and place was very clean and order got prepared very fast planning to come again in future
I love the food here, grown up eating here, but too sad to see the hygiene level like this . A cockroach for me is horrible experience. Kent‚Äôs for me got ruined
There was hair in the veg burger we ordered and I tried calling the food joint but the phone was constantly busy and no one picked up my call .

Came in after seeing the illy board to have coffee. The coffee is fantastic. Very good staff. Good place for a coffee in Defence Colony

Amici defence colony managed to mix up our pizza order. Made the gluten free pizza with toppings meant for the normal base and vice versa.
A recipe has no soul, but you as the chef must bring tje soul to the food.  The chef at this place certainly did bring the soul to the food as the taste on offer at Guppy ie exquisite.  The place is cute cafe set up at the heart of lodi market, with soothing interiors. The staff is very interested in taking care of you and that‚Äôs all that matters. Great hospitality on offer.  What should you order - Bacon and Cream cheese sushi roll, just the right sushi to send your taste buds to heaven.  - Wok Fried soft shell crab, brilliant for your palate, just the perfect flavour. Must try!  - Fuji Lava, oh what a lipsmacking cocktail in brandy base.   - Black Chicken Nabe Hotpot, PLEASE DONT MISS THIS.   A brilliant place for some delicious food and cocktails, certainly the one to spend your time with pals.

In this blog post, I cover the all-new winter menu at Guppy, the oldest and the most reliable contemporary Japanese bar and kitchen in Delhi serving authentic, healthy Japanese food.  What's the first outlet that comes to your mind when you think of Sushi, Sashimi, or Ramen? If you answered Guppy, chances are that your guess is as good as mine!  Up until a few years ago, many believed that Japanese cuisine was all about raw seafood. Guppy broke this stereotype by introducing a range of delicious vegetarian food with an emphasis on freshness and quality ingredients.  By focusing on veggie delights like the rock corn tempura or the chili lime dressed agedashi tofu, Guppy has very well understood the pulse of its customers!
Guppy is the place where you can enjoy authentic Japanese food and drinks. I love the ambiance with beautiful decor and graffiti walls. This winters, they have special drinks and food which was really amazing and delicious. I recommend you to try out these : Mulled Wine, Gintack, Whiskey toddy Bacon and Cream Cheese Sushi Rolls, Fried Crabs, Salt pepper Calamari, Mushi Dori, Nabe hotpots. Do visit this place and enjoy your food with amazing ambience and you can click out great pics for Insta stories üôÇ.
The manager doesn‚Äôt care to change the food if it‚Äôs bad. He will not even remove it from the bill. Horrible experience. And he will talk to you in the worst way possible.
one of my favourite indian food destination in delhi dal makhani being my utmost favourite here.¬† their sea food is also very popular.
Suffocating, pathetic lettuce salad, vegetarian food very ordinary, waste of money

Went for a lunch here on Friday. We ordered following: Chicken sukka ( from south indian menu) - It was average, too much thick coconut paste masala was there and we expected less of coconut. Chicken 65 - best of all starters. It was marinated chicken fried. Chicken tandoori - it was good , can be ordered. Chicken malai tikka - nothing fancy. Quite normal. Surmai Fish fry - It was tasty. If u like fish, try this boneless fish fry. Keema mutter - it was also good but not that awesome i was expecting. Chicken handi - it was perfect . Best among gravies. Hot and sour chicken soup - not like one i like. It was not the red one. Lemon coriander chicken - too tangy and i loved it. Just a clear chicken soup.  Overall a good place to have food. Ambience average. Staff is nice.  P.S. I cudnt click any pic as staff served the entire dishes.
Nice place, courteous staff, good food. I would recommend visitors to try the Ghee roast Chicken. Didn‚Äôt like the Swagath Special Squid although the waiter recommended it. Overall, the place is definitely worth a visit. The food certainly has got character.
I receive half dosa And the chatnies are as cold as ice that means they are not fresh. Such a bad experience I not suggest you to pls don't order food form them they are not up to the mark. I give you -100star
Vada was nice
Ordered -2plain dosas. They were delivered with nice quantity of 2 kind of chatnis- tomato&onion, coconut and mint. These were delivered too late, don't know why they took more that 40-50min. But happy with the quantity of chatni and sambar they served. Sambar was really thick and full of veggies as i like it. Coconut chatni was thick and grainy, serving like a gud brand.
Sagar Ratna food menu is not updated in the ZOMATO app, then their behaviour is very rude and even Zomato customer service is very dumb and illiterate. I had ordered food twice from sagar Ratna. In my second order they were asking me to pay for coffee and ZOMATO rider took my Upma back for which I had paid, they were too adamant they are not refunded my cash.
Being a resident of Defcol, been here several times.¬†   PlusVery fast serviceAffordableDecent food taste Negatives:Food has been very north indianizedNothing exciting on the menuCafe feelFeel rushed Their location at the Ashoka is upscale but at twice the price.¬† Food is the same.¬† There are amny other south indian restaurants I prefer over Sagar.
Tuesday treats are worth the trial, they have this really amazing cream of mushroom soup Loved it so rich and creamy
Chicken nachos which we can have whenever we want to and also a side benefit they give unlimited coke

The place is amazing, quite a place to be when you wanna have a time with you friends! Great food and ambience. Krishna, the staff member was friendly as well.
""
Rose pasta was really good.. just the right flavour
Owl Is Well starts delivering at 6pm and goes on till 4 in the morning. Their menu is a delish mix of pasta, burgers and pizza with fun names like Alice In Wonderland and Spill The Beans. They give you the option to BYOP - Bake Your Own Pizza so i customised my own pizza, with multigrain base, bbq tomato sauce, cheddar and mozzarella cheese and lots of veg toppings like bell peppers, jalepenos, onions, cheery tomatoes. Trust me the pizza here is crust worthy! Its winters in delhi so the food was not that warm but the taste was awesome!  Even the jalepeno poppers were so good, crunchy, spicy we missed out having a dip for the poppers but the taste was so good. The best part is you can get a delivery in the odd hours and food is delicious!
Great food
Excellent food.
Worst Pizza of all time with no taste and quality , they should maintain the quality and taste . Not properly cooked even .
I have ordered from this place multiple times. The pizza has always been the best never got disappointed. This time I ordered mac n cheese too and I was so impressed üòç perfect mac n cheese. I liked it more than the pizza whereas I didn't even have any hopes

Red sauce pasta has huge room for improvement. Chicken pizza was nice.

Vikram has been an amazing host. Highly recommended! Good job, team. look forward to visiting again

Had a great time at Pa Pa Ya. Extremely scrumptious food and amazing drink. Staff was very courteous and gentle especially Mr. Vikram and very sweet girl Ms. Smriti.
Good Sushi and Great Service. Special thanks to our attender Vikram.
üòãüòãüòãüòãI loved it
Hot and spicy and nice o loved it
I ordered kadhai chicken..so awesome in taste.. And chicken is freshly baked. üçó
Paneer makhani was below average
Love the food here, order regularly. Giving only 4 stars though because I find that their meat is not great these days: too bony and only 3 pieces for a main course order. In the past they used to be quite generous with the meat so hope someone from the restaurant reads this and improves in that area.
Nice spot for a sit-down Indian meal! They have a variety of vegetarian and vegan options, and the interior is very clean and elegant. The only bad part is that it's always crowded so it takes some time to be seated. The highlights of the visit were samosas, the leaf salad & tofu. I guess I will try more soon :)

Amazing food and brilliant taste! Spell bound service. I wish i could give extra stars for professional, well trained, well groomed, and quick service.
It was great experience dining at Burma Burma, select city,was able to get authentic Burmese cusine without onion, garlic.Ambience is good & staff helpful & courteous.
So recently tried the authentic food from orient heritage. I ordered Sour chilli dimsums, chilly potatoes and tamarind potatoes. It was the first time, I tried tamarind potatoes and they were amazing. And their Chilly potatoes were also good. But sour chilli dimsums stole the limelights. Great experience.
I odered food online from this outlet for a home delivery. I odered ‚ö´ Spring Roll ‚ö´ Chilli Noodles ‚ö´ Honey Chilli Potato Food was delicious üòã. Really i liked üòç their spring roll and honey chilli potato with gravy.üòã Taste was differ to others. Food was perfectly cooked ‚úîÔ∏è Delivery on time ‚úîÔ∏è Quantity and quality was good‚úîÔ∏è We received warm üî• food without spillage. Highly recommended üëçüèª Try once....
Thai Food At The Best  I am happy in every terms of their amazing
I tried the food here and trust me that they serve the authentic Asian food. So one of the item I want to highlight is Chinese noodles in peanut sauce, it is for someone who likes peanut flavour and it's fusion with their noodles is pretty awesome. I also tried cold Vietnamese rolls and they didn't disappoint me too :).
I placed an order at 9:20 pm, it was supposed to be delivered by 10:20 pm, was actually delivered by 11:50 pm and the best part was they didn‚Äôt send the complete order. I had to start hungry bcoz what they ended up delivering wasn‚Äôt enough for 2 people. This was the most ridiculous service i have ever received from a restaurant that is highly rated on zomato.
Have you ever been to a place where the food is so beautiful that you don‚Äôt have the heart to destroy it by eating it? Well, the Runway Project was that place for me.   The place‚Äôs understated ambience belies the visual treat you‚Äôre in for when the food is served. Each and every dish is presented with such thought and care. Our cigar rolls, for instance, had a beautiful colour scheme - soft shades of pastel. The bright arrabiata pasta was served in a contrasting black dish on the other hand. The Calabrese pizza looked like a mini garden. And, it is not just the presentation, but every dish they that served tasted as great as it looked.   The winner of the show was the dessert - aptly named Godfather. The dessert came in a wooden box of cigars, and it was in the form of big, fat brown cigars. The cigars were made of chocolate and there was creamy tiramisu inside them - it was like an explosion rich, delicious layers and flavours in my mouth - a real foodgasm indeed.   The service was quick and the staff was friendly. I will definitely go back to this place when I go to Delhi next time.
Great service by Raju, thanks brother
The servers Naga and Raju were very courteous and friendly. Loved their service.
Hey . I was attended by Raju and this is my 5th visit to this restaurant. Amazing food . With an amazing ambience .  Love the taste of the food here . I would strongly recommend to try the penne pasta and margherita pizza .  Good luck to this restaurant.
We were attended by Pooja. She was super polite and guided us through the menu in detail. We ordered two pastas, chicken genovese and aglio e olio, both of them being really well prepared and up to the mark. We also had a mc‚Äôqueen burger whose house made patty was really succulent. Loved the vibe of the place! Must visit.
""
Never knew I would find such good veg food from here. Since Navratras are upon us we couldn't have anything in non veg. So I ordered Dal Makhani, Paneer Tikka and Butter Naans. Dal Makhani was delicious and so was Paneer Tikka. The dal was very thick. Even the flavours were top notch. This meal truly made my day!
""
Dilli bc serves great north indian always, ordered for dal makhni and shahi paneer this time. The curries were really good and rich in flavour, really loved the tasted even the pacakaging was really good. Ordering from here again soon.
""
We ordered lotus stems and chiken strips. They were burnt and horrible in taste. Hot chocolate tastes like sweet hot water. Not a good place to hang out with friends.
I really don't know why they have a rating of 4, cause they sure don't deserve it. This was the first five i visited champa gali and came straight to pho King due to Zomato reviews. The bubble tea that they claim to be really good, is really bad. We ordered mango iced bubble tea, it was crap. The after taste was weird. The burrito was almost tasteless. The salsa was the worst I've ever had. My protein choice was peri peri chicken, that was not what peri peri is and it wasn't cooked properly either. I could only eat half of it and wasn't able to finish it.
This place is so bad. Don‚Äôt waste your money on their cold , bland and tasteless food. The waiters at pho king are so absent minded and didn‚Äôt even bother to give good customer service. The food arrived after 45 mins of waiting and god it was so horrible. The rice rolls were pathetic and watery. And the fries were stale and tasteless. The only thing that was okay was the outside seating, apart from that everything was shitty. VISIT SOME OTHER CAFE IN CHAMPA GALI AND AVOID THIS ONE !
Cute little interior.. Food was good... Pad Thai was lil sweet rest all good!
Good place ..... Foods on the better side! Ambience is calm and pleasing. We ordered Braised Pork Belly, Mexican Salsa Fries and Peri Peri Chicken Burrito.  Apart from Burrito, the food was really good  There are many more in Champa Gali, but this one deserves another visit.
This is a cozy cafe toh hang out with friends for snacks or a brunch date.The white sauce pasta is extremely yummy.Also the paneer tikka sandwich is very tasty with a twist to it.The pizza served is also very delicious and with a lot of cheese.In short we absolutely loved the food from this place but the hot chocolate was a bit This is quite a photogenic place as well where one can get a bunch of pictures clicked with Friends.It is also good for someone looking for a quite place to hang out alone.
Amazing food! Pizza was really nice! With good prices! Suits all pockets! Would surely visit again !! There was young crowd all over. A good Experience.
""
It's quite an over hyped place. Food is really not upto the mark. Piri fires tastes bad ( like fries mixed with red chilli powder) can't eat and I just hate wasting food but that was not edible.
""
So went to this place on Sunday afternoon and felt a little disappointed with the kind of food taste service . There were a lot many honey bees around the terrace sitting area and non of the staff cared abt getting them rid off. Would not recommend
Great food, great roof top ambiance üòª We went on 26 Jan so tasted almost all the amazing  mocktails! Ordered steamed veggies which came in a good amount for 3 ppl. And roti pizza which was quite light because of the roti base yet yummy. Staff was courteous too despite huge crowd. Would love to visit this place at night someday.
Great ambiennce.. lovely food
Amazing staff and ambience .... loved the live music !!
Loved it! Absolutely loved it! Couldn't have asked for a better night! Great service, great ambience and amazing vibe! It's an amazing experience! Super yum food! You guys are my favourite for spaghetti now! And your dense chocolate cake- it's one of the best i've had so far! Thankyou for serving that! Looking forward to explore your entire menu! Thankyou Team Dramz!

We went for our 3rd wedding anniversary! We had little food so can't comment much - it wasn't great but we'll served and a quiet time, we liked the ambiance and the feel that the place has, however, when we entered I specifically told the manager to arrange for a dessert for my anniversary and he said it will be done! It was never done, the manager forgot about it and since it was a surprise I couldn't point it out infront of my husband. It was such a let down. This request is usually entertained in the smallest of places and this was one of the best in South Delhi and the manager couldn't care much inspite of specific instructions.

I am not exaggerating the fact that i wanted to visit olive for almost a decade . I always felt with every nice restaurant that i was visiting across the world,  it was helping me to prepare to go to Olive and such was the hype while growing up and my experience was so mixed that i am still processing the entire experience.  I will start with good things :-   I ordered old fashioned, mulled wine and a chile merlot wine and were brilliant. One of the best old fashioned so far.  Olive‚Äôs ambience is straight out of the books . One of the prettiest restaurants i have ever been to.  Barley Risotto was mind blowing. Lately i have fallen in love with Barley based dishes replacing Rice in such a nice manner that it almost surprises you.  Winter Pumpkin soup was really nice too and with a base of butter milk and pumpkin it makes you have so many discussions about what fusion food can do.  Now the bad part :-  Warm figs salad didnt make sense at all, sundried Jam was a little overwhelming and compromised the entire recipe. Eventually there was a hair like string and we had to return the dish. Staff was nice enough to return it and not charge us and i would give it a benefit of doubt that it was something else and not a hair.  Cauliflower & Labnch was one of the most recommended by the waiter but was the worst among whatever we ordered.  Soft shell crab was just ok and nothing unforgettable.  I am fine with smaller portions and gorgeous presentations as long as taste is at the center of it which was not there at all. I didn‚Äôt have a single dish to which i could way that it is not served or made anywhere like this.  My biggest complain is with the staff , while we are talking about one of the finest restaurant in the city, waiting staff has to compliment the class of the restaurant. I hate to mention it but it did spoil the overall experience.   No matter how pretty the food looked or how beautiful the property is , taste was missing and the hype of last decade didnt deliver at all.   I so wish olive delivered on the hype that i created in last decade.
A very asthetic place to have a gala time with friends.The waffle sundae here tastes delicious.It is a perfect blend of flavours not to sweet.The place has various locations where you can get pictures clicked.The have an outdoor seating area as well which when lit up in the dark looks absolutely stunning.The lighting here is perfect.This place is perfect for a sunday brunch with Friends or family enjoying the happy time chatting.This cafe also has various games such as uno etc which makes it different from others.

I visited Rose cafe around 5 years back while it had just opened then. Gradually this place gained a huge popularity and this cafe was on my try list yet again. On my second visit I found the seating to have become clumsier in order to accomadate maximum possible seats in the outdoor area which felt quite congested. Indoor seating is rustic English interiors in their signature blue nd pink theme.  We ordered Mediterranean vegetables and pesto Rose cafe Melt which is basically an open sandwich. It was decent no wow factor to it.. Mozzarella baked penne was too scanty on the portion and was like a regular red sauce pasta served in a baking dish. The vegetarian White pizza was the show stealer, loaded with a beautiful bechamel sauce and the reason for my rating.. A must try for a spinach lover. For desserts we had the waffle sundae, and honestly it felt way too overpriced for a tall glass of gelato nd waffle tit bits. The dark chocolate gelato we customised was no doubt great,but somehow it dint seem price worth at all for the basic elements the sundae had.. I had greater expectations from the place considering the popularity and pricing or maybe other dish options could have been a better choice, but nevertheless it was a sweet experience overall on a sunny winter afternoon with a steaming hot hearty Italian meal.
I have a tattoo of ‚Äúla vie en rose‚Äù as a tribute to this cafe. It is my obsession, my one true love. It started with an order of aglio olio, after 7 times of going with the same dish I spread my wings to mezze platter, sausage platter and the beet root risotto. Every dish has its uniqueness and tastes better each time.‚ù§Ô∏è

Great place overlooking Qutab Minar n designer showroom..

This place doesn't need any review nevertheless, the awesome food - the amazing ambiance says it all. I went on the first day of 2020 - 1st Jan - BRUNCH! And, trust me, when it comes to food - I literally have kick-started 2020 in such a delicious way!¬† From starters to dessert - everything is just YUM!¬† A brilliant place to chill and unwind with your favorite people!
Food taste can be improved
Went there in the evening with my wife on her birthday ... The ambience of the place is amazing ... The drinks and the food is also good but its a place where you will enjoy the ambience
Amazing ambience, excellent service and exotic dishes. Every dish was amazing and the way they served was appreciable. Very courteous staff. Would love to visit often.
This is the best place for a romantic getaway with the best foodie at your realm.I had a pasta white sauce which was very tasty and prawns too with a chicken pizza which was thin crust and quality of service was high.  We also had a banoffee jar and in drinks we ordered mocktails which also included Virgin Mojito
Needless to say - The place is made for romantic dates! A little high on the budget (even with Zomato Gold), but so worth it!   Open garden, candlelight, green and peaceful, sangrias with a scintillating aura. Perfect!  The food was better than average, can‚Äôt say the best. But overall a beauteous experience.
Great place if you are planning to go on a date and also want to have great food. Went on a sunday afternoon. The palce wasn't crowded. The music was not loud. We just had a great lunch and conversation and had amazing food. Had the best prawns there. Although a bit expensive, but its worth it!
""
The place is good for quite and plush ambiance. It's one of my recommendation for coffee.. Picolo latte is one of unique hot coffee served there. The food i tried was fries and sandwich. I packed the raisin cookie which is quite scrumptious. The environment is clean and kept chic with a Air purifier. The place serves wifi too. One downside i have noticed and wish to share is the washroom facilities. Try not to use it .. its not upto the standard.
We had nitro coffee and iced cappuccino.. Nitro coffee is coffee without milk.. and it was strong enough to keep us fresh and awake. Loved the iced cappuccino. The place has pretty ambience, do check out the sitting area at the back.. Pretty chill place to hang out with friends and have a good time.
Zoodles @ Blue Tokai, Delhi  Taste - 5, Quantity - 3, Quality - 5, Hygiene - 4, Service - 5, Ambiance - 5  Verdict - Must Eat This  The moment I read 'Zoodles', I knew I had to order this. Zoodles were noodles made of 'Zucchini'. The zoodles were nicely seasoned and served with veggie balls and fresh greens. It felt so refreshing & light. The ambiance of the cafe is so cool.  P.S. - Blue Tokai also serves coffee tasting menu. Try that too.  #musteatthis #delhi #saadidilli #delhincr #delhieats #fusion #creative #foodblogger #foodgasm #foodporn #craving
I order aglio olio and espresso in morning.I'm glad that they win my heart everytime. My brother love this food always. The coffee was to good to start a day. Thankyou
Tandoori the love of most people, well but i love it most and guess what i was just surfing through Zomato and found out this great variety of tandoori and ordered chicken tandoori and man it was too delecious .. Should really try itüíò
Well i just came home from work and wanted something to fill me up so while i was scrolling on Zomato i found this great place and it prices were reasonable too . I ordered a chicken Alfredo and it came in great package and the taste was just upto the mark and really delicious üíïüíïüíï
I am really so lucky that I tried this place. I ordered food online for many place but didn't get a food like this from anywhere. This place is literally different and absolutely fantastic. Their food packaging is so standardized and classy and when I open the food box, the amazing smell of their food spread around in my home. And when I tasted it, it just melted in my mouth. Loved it.
This is an amazing place which delivers drooling food. I ordered delish fish fingers from this place and it was very well cooked. Fish has a really good and fresh aroma. And every bite of it was a blissful. I really loved it.
I ordered chicken malai seekh and splendid chicken fingers from this place and literally loved it. The food was lip smacking and seems real fresh. Chicken of this place was properly marinated in malai and well grilled to give more taste. Amazed with this place food and really enjoyed it.
Many of my friends ND blogger friend suggest me this beautiful Cafe Dori, I came here with my friends, Ambience was good, food was below expectations, Pumpkin soup was just yuckk.. üò£ brownies and almond cake was yummy. One more thing I wanted to write here that is price are not justifying the food quality ND taste.
A tucked away concept shop-restaurant: Great place to meet a long lost friend  Cafe Dori was quite buzzing on a Sunday afternoon and they don't take table bookings, so had to wait in the courtyard. Can't' complain as it gave us an opportunity to look around the classily done-up leather shop.¬†  After a quick cuppa of coffee we ordered:  Pasta with Pork Mince: A wholesome meal to line the stomach after a heady Saturday night Chermoula Chicken: Smallish dish of roasted chicken with a delicious side!¬†¬†  We went for late breakfast and ended up having a meal instead. Decent meal in an open day-light-filled interiors; it's the best way to nurse the hangover on a Sunday noon!¬†  A point less for the service...we were handed over a bill with an extra zero!!! Thank heavens we noticed it while paying by credit card, else it would have left a temporary hole in our pockets! Also was disappointed to not find Khachapuri on the menu, heard a lot about it and was craving for it for a while!¬†  Will definitely return to savor the sumptuous breakfast spread soon!
""
Just went to this cozy hidden gem. Food was somewhat good with very few vegan options. Ambience is so good and nappa dori store along with this caf√© make it the perfect experience. Only thing what I didn't like was the attitude of one server who didn't had proper knowledge about the cafe and also wasn't looking much happy and acknowledging. I hope to visit this place again.
Went to this place for breakfast today , I really liked the ambience and the food .. ordered breakfast bun and mixed berry shake which was great the only thing I did not like was the portion size .. I‚Äôve never seen a burger this small in my life .. it looked real fancy but not worth spending 650rs just for a burger that tiny ..

It's a family restaurant, people can get taste food on reasonable price. Food quality is average, but service is bad. You guys can try it once.
Chilly chaap was not up to the mark, chaap doesn‚Äôt seems fresh it was very hard to chew.
"Hello foodies,¬† So, I recently ordered food from this really good outlet called ""Food Forest""¬† It's one of the best restaurant of Chhatarpur to have your vegetarian meal at pocket-friendly rates. The restaurant offers you a variety of food you can choose from. I personally ordered Parantha Combo with 1pc Gulab Jamun. The Gulab Jamun was missing in the order but the rest of the food was quite delicious.¬† They serve you a good quality hyenic food that too with a good quantity. Tandoori Kulcha + Chole + Raita + 1pc Gulab Jamun Paneer Prantha with Dahi Parantha with Dal Makhni Parantha Combos Are some of the highly recommended dishes from this restaurant."
Nice little place in Chhatarpur to order chaats and street snacks like chaat papdi, gol gappa, tikkis and samosa. Thye make a really nice samosa chat too which is my favourite. Must try their gol gappas and for breakfast u must try their chhole bhature.

Last Night I ordered food from Daawat E' Bhoj. It was Dal Bukhara and Kadhai Paneer with Butter Naan. One of the best Kadhai Paneer I have ever had. It was very well made with appropriate seasoning. Dal was also delicious. It was well cooked in butter and cream. Will order soon again.
Dal hukhara, mushroom do pyaaza, with butter garlic naan. Buttery delicious. The main course made me write anything good about this place here. Its simply finger licking good. Service is amazing. Place is very good for good food. Even tried the penne pasta and its red sauce tasted great. Try out this place and food will be really great.
Ordered item - Chicken Changezi  Delivery- Good enough.  Taste and Experience - great taste..nicely cooked chicken and nice and thick gravy..whenever and wherever I order for changezi I always request it to be thick gravy and super spicy and it was great that the restaurant took care of it. So it was a good experience.  Packaging and presentation - Great   Pricing - Okayish, slightly on the higher side as compared to others in the market.  Overall a good experience.
Dawat E' bhoj,a multiple cuisine serving outlet mainly north indian.I very recently had dinner here with my friends.We ordered kurkure momo, paneer butter masala and mutton rogan josh.The food tasted fine but lacked spiciness but made up with its presentation. Ambience was also decent.Indoor seating was available.
Love to order from here for their delicious food - the momos are must haves here. We absolutely love them.   The Chinese food is good - they have a lot of variety and  stuff to try out - we also enjoyed their honey chilli potato- it‚Äôs fresh and very delicious ! also their main course has so many varieties you are bound to get confused .. and everything we‚Äôve tried is really good .. we love the paneer butter masala it‚Äôs cooked to the core with perfection .. the chicken also good here!  Do try out this place !
You have one of the best cakes to be customised in south delhi. Loved the red velvet and pineapple cake! These are the best and the chocolates are nice too
""
I ordered this cake sitting in Bangalore for a friend in Delhi as a surprise. I have no clue about places in Delhi but found the options of cakes here very unique and chose to order from here. Hemang went out of his way to help and made sure the cake was delivered at the right place asap. Thanks for being super helpful. As for the cake, it was not just over but it was relished and enjoyed by everyone who had it. Cant wait to have a piece myself as well. It looked so yummy. Thanks again for the overall experience. Wonderful hospitality and great food :)
The cake was excellent. It tasted as good as it looked. It was so well prepared with Hazelnut and other ingredients. Though the price is bit higher for a half kg yet the cake was worth it.
We ordered a smoked whiskey jar cake and a chocolate turtle cake with rossetes. Smoked whiskey jar cake justified its name. It had a very good smokey flavoured chocolate and a whiskey flavour to it. It was beautifully designed in a good quality jar. Also the cake - was very beautifully crafted , and delivered very carefully. The inside chocolate layer was not so sugary yet very delicious and very soft. Would Totally recommend!!

Food was utterly tasteless, we had ordered paneer paratha, kadhai chaap, matar paneer and gobhi, it was horrible, we had to throw away as there was only watery gravy with one piece of chaap Or paneer floating, worst food
Overall the food was ok for it's price. The butter naan was very good. Tandoori disappointed me, it was very hard and tough. I ordered Paneer pasanda which didn't pass my expectations. Although the price was less but taste was also very low and food quality was also not so good. Overall it was an ok types experience.....
After college we‚Äô re hungry someone suggest us to try # Gopi vaishno dhawa we have order Kadhai paneer, pili dal makhni , baighan Bharata , missi roti, butter naan food was amazing
We ordered matar paneer, kadhai chaap, gobi and paneer parantha from this restaurant. I can't explain, how bad the food was. The gravy was watery and utterly tasteless. Paranthas were undercooked and underwhelming as well. Not recommended at all. Quantity was pretty low as well.
Regular customer here. Normally order the original chicken doner and the chipotle chicken doner. Like the chipotle one slightly better than the original one. One downside is their prices which are exorbitantly high and their product is not worth that price. Giving one star less for that reason only.
We had ordered 3 chicken doner rolls from this place looking at the reviews and star rating given by zomato. As you can see in the pics for approx RS 300+ taxes we get a tiny roll cut in two. It's not worth more than RS 50. Secondly for 3 rolls we got one small sauce packet also in the pics. It left us very unhappy with a hot mouth with chilli's and a hot head due to the service.
Doner Grill is best place for Doner and Roll. I have ever had.. But i was suprised of there Doner.. Which taste perfect.. You must try..
It was great experiance with Doner Grill. One of the best Doner in Delhi.. Absolutly recomended to all of you . Value for money.
greek salad. Here the secret is the vegetables well mixed in the meyonese which becomes heavy and fulfilling to eat. It also gives a wonderful taste.
I went here for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. The ambience is quirky and cool.  What we had - 1) golgappas with three types of water and this was very tasty. 2) Amritsari chole kulche were delicious too. Very filling, great quantity. 3) Thaali was good except dal makhni, which can be improved a bit. Otherwise all elements were lipsmacking.  Overall, a nice experience.
Tried their cafe thali and Palak patta chat .  Palak patta chaat was so crispy and yummy that I can go everyday for this. Amazing chaat.  Thali was fabulous too . Every item in thali was satisfying and 10/10 from my side quantity was great . Service was great too. Smiling and welcoming staff .  üëåüèªdefinitely coming over again n again!
Amazing ambiance and awesome food. Would recommend it strongly to all my friends. Their veg thali is elaborate with finger licking items in it. The mutton and paneer dishes are amazing.
Today I went this place ,the place was so good and staff also very good , quick. Service and food was also so good .‚Äù, I ordered chicken malai tikka , virgin mozito, strawberry shake , and in lunch I ordered tamatar murgh and lacchaa parantha it was good in taste.thanks
It was a great experience n I really liked the decor of the place n the traditional way of serving the food n new ideas n twists in the food!!üç±

This place is a life saver at night. It's little hard to locate but you can always count in it when hunger strikes at night. I had mixed meat fried rice. It was amazing. The staff is very friendly and wants to cater according to your needs!!
Recently ordered food from this outlet late in the night. The food was nicely prepared. I enjoyed the onion rings and the chilly chicken. The dips provided were amazing as well but people having trouble with extra spice watch out and keep your water ready along - you have be warned :)  I loved it though.  The Keema parantha could have been better though.  i would like for it to be more filled with its outer portion to be more soft but hey its what I would like, others might find it good the way it is.  The outlet goes to my bookmark list.  Keep up the good work.
had ordered chicken pasta which was simply boiled and lots of cheese was put on it..no flavour at all and the cheese was burnt too...chicken pizza also lacked flavour..sad experience
This is really amazing place to find good and delicious food, I went here with office colleague here sitting arrangements and other hospitality was amazing
Was craving for pizza tonight so ordered pizza from here .it the worst and saddest Pizza one can ever have. It was cold and not even edible .  Surely not worth a penny

Decent place to pack a pizza home. Not a big brand yet. But if they can keep the quality n pricing. Can grow over time.  Will revisit. Try the cheese burst.
The pizza was so tasty and I like this pizza and they so many time we are going to pizza King and I order a pizza and there was a gud ambience and gud setting arrangements and good light and I love that place and I am going so many in a that place and I like the place..

This is the best place for taking dinner. I tried my dinner with kadai chicken and butter naan which taste was awsome and i want to try some other item from there next time.

Had tried this place long back. The tandori momos was amazing. Other thing was also good. But there was limited space for accommodation The staff were generous but the service was also late. That's why ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

Looking for delicious or scrumptious pizza?? If yes then you must checkout this place which serves tasty pizza. Though service takes a little time. Recommending 6/10 Do try it yourself.
Hi¬†  I ordered one pizza combo from pizza club at 9:59 pm¬†  and i didn't get order till now¬†  When i called to pizza club they said that they didn't get any order through Zomato¬†  This is my back to back two cancellation of order¬†  Is this your services to customers where customer is waiting for an hour and then suddenly cancelled the order at a time when i have no options left¬†  If this is your services then i should need to know why Zomato is guaranteeing for on time delivery options
"Accepts my order, shows me a waiting time of 1:05 hrs, and after 1:30 hrs refunds my money saying there's no ""Delivery Boy"". I just felt like I loaned a stranger 200 bucks for an hour. :D"
Pizza club is famous for its pizza. The price of pizza is pocket friendly. We are easily enjoying the birthday party with our friends. The service is good.
I ordered cake for my best friends birthday. The cake was yummuy and delicious. We really enjoyed the black forest cake. I will surly order from this outlet in future.
The best delivery for service online cake delivery so yummy
OCD is the best service provider in Delhi and they are doing their best and thank you for making my day remarkable call support
I orderd a cake for a birthday and this app was showing me that order will be arrived by 11:40pm I was waiting and waiting and calling the restaurant and told them its 12am already where is my order and they replied very shamelessly aapka order delivery guy dhoondta dhoondta aajayega I mean seriously why did i pay for that cake which is never arrived And the zomato was like sprry sir we cant help you are then why the hell did i order from your app am i a fool . Then i was waiting full of embarrassment and insult and then after 2hours of waiting They said your order is cancelled and your amount will be back in your account in next 7days Like seriously can you imagine the level of frustation i had last night No NO DON'T TRUST THIS OUTLET AND THIS APP They'll make you suffer someday and they'll be like i am sorry sir just like a doctor after a serious operation This outlet is shit and I don't need to tell how was your service you nuts . You just took my money you theif.

Everything was fine... Delivery was a bit late which was not an issue for me...and manager changed the address to where I wanted it to be delivered. I called them personally and asked to write name on cake which they didn't do...even they committed it on phone...the cake quality was not upto the mark and was not fresh... Embarrassed me in front of birthday girl.
Good work nice food
The shop is good but i seriously doubt their hygiene conditions

They served swiggy food to me and that too in bad packing anyone may have cancelled swiggy order and then reorder to zomato. Pathetic packing. Masal dosa is just okay but zomato delivery boy is nice he delivered the food on time with smile on this cheek. 4 star for zomato delivery boy and 2 star for food
Very good friend hopefully we will meet soon

Ordered Paneer Dosa and Masala Dosa! both are oily and soggy, Sambar was tasteless, cold and watery.. they didn't even send the cutlery with food.. Disappointed üëé
Amazing place to have south indian food.... the best part is its open 24*7.... had their cheese masala dosa.... the dosa was perfect combination of cheese with masala.... loved the sambhar and nariyal chutney as well.... the owner is also very friendly and customer centric....

I can eat a tub of ice cream. Enjoy there all ice cream before it melts.

Gopal‚Äôs 56 is a must try place in Kalkaji. Their mango shake with ice cream is a must try. They serve a variety of ice cream flavours as well.
This place has an amazing ambience and is known for their unique platters. Went there two weeks ago to have lunch and the food was delicious. Tried their butter chicken shots, the presentation was on point and the gravy was scrumptious. We tried the panner tikka pizza as well but it was not worth at all. The amount of cheese was very low and it was very sweet in taste, so that's something we would never recommend.
Very nice fine dining restaurant. Good ambience. Great music and food was superb. I really want to recommend non vegetarian starters here. I love chicken Tikka, bhatti chicken, butter chicken roll. Even Paneer roll is very nice. Also Dahi ke sholey was so good.
This place serves really good & yum Indian food. Their food packaging for delivery is also done quite well. The Dal Makhani is an all time hit and if you're willing to try something beyond the regular chicken dishes like Butter Chicken & Kardhai Chicken (which they also make well) then Rara Chicken & Chicken Saagwala are a must have and I loved the overall preparation (including taste, gravy consistency & quantity of gravy and having a standard chicken/mutton/paneer portion serving). Go ahead & give this place a try to satisfy your Indian food taste buds & cravings.

Used to like this place for cocktails and staff. The new manager is absolutely hopeless. The bartender can't make the same cocktails either. Though the person serving us was polite and took care of things. Never going back again.
The Thai green curry was well tasting but less than minimal Veges served in that, a pint (330 ml) is being served as a ‚Äòmug‚Äô... verbal description and quantity was misleading as the server described as 500 ml... and suggested that a pitcher with 1500 ml could  be ordered, yet a mug of 330 ml (which literally also was a glass of beer) was definitely not done and expected   Staff was of below average caliber.   Over all a wasted experience!! Won‚Äôt recommend at all.
The restaurant mixes up biriyanis. The staff doesn't care about people who are waiting in line. The cost of each packet of biryani is exorbitantly high while quantity is less. Waste of money.
I loved the foods alot
Small Hidden Gem in CR Park. Kali Mirch Chicken Tikka was very nice and differently made with chunky kali mirch coating. I found the biryani decent, could be better. Overall a nice place for dinner with friends.
Food taste quality has deteriorated.Went to have egg roll it was the worst decision.Absolutely bad in taste they burnt the paratha and the person who was preparing it was arguing with me because I told him that he burnt it.Even I have found a fly in Malai Tikka.Please avoid this shop not worth it.
Well being a Bengali, we crave for biriyani. I have had some awesome biriyanis in Kolkata. So when I saw this outlet, the first impression was sheer joy. So I started ordering from here and have ordered multiple times. But unfortunately I'm seeing continuous decrease of service, quality and quantity of food. Half of the times they don't add either egg or the potato which are the integral parts of kolkata biriyani. Sometimes the order comes without salad or a missing piece of chicken. So after ordering, I call them 2-3 times to make sure they send complete pack. I ordered 2 plates of biriyanis last night at around 11pm and spoke to someone in the shop complaining about missing items and the rubbery chicken. That guy was neither helpful nor good in customer handling. This makes me feel that I should stop ordering from here and switch to other outlets like Aminia or City of joy. So if you're reading this review, please don't be certain that your ordered food will come intact. Please don't relax on your couch and wait for the guy to deliver half of your order. Rather constantly call the shop and ask them to add all the items properly. May they bless you with a good and complete food.

For American taste and unbelievable monster pizza and also unbelievable moster burger are great. But service is not good enough and also stuffing of ingredients not good.but it provides very nice sitting area
The ambience was good. Service was fine too. However, some of the items are overpriced (not the same as the menu provided on zomato). Monster burger was enough for 5 people. Overall taste was good. Food items rated according to me (considering the taste only): Jalapeno cheese poppers 10/10 Pizza 9/10 Piri piri fries 7/10 Monster Burger (The Hulk) 7/10 Monster Shake (kit kat) 6/10 Coffee and cookie milkshake 5/10 Oreo cheesecake milkshake 8/10 Nutella milkshake 7/10

One of the best ‚Äúthru South Indian taste‚Äù food provider

Welcome drink was chaach. Ordered- Mysore masala dosa- nice and crispy and imyes it was perfectly spicy as i want but when i tasted it, it had a little bitter taste, felt like the dosa was burnt. Inside masal was also little burnt. My friend who loves naivedyam alot was also there with me, she also said that it wasn't upto the mark as they normally have. I expect that they correct it next time we come and i will surely visit to taste your other specialiaties.
it was a well specialised south indian resturant food was awesome even the Ambience of this restaurant was very soft staff was also very polite and cooperative
Went in for a family dinner the place was mostly empty with some guest for buffet. The spaghetti pasta in the whole 3 course meal that we had ordered was of some worth other than that any of the other dishes could not justify their price tags. We had even ordered a kebab platter of sort which was around 1500INR and was seriously not worth 500 . Food lacks presentation as well as taste. Place is not recommended from my side specially if you want to try out North Indian food with family
Me and my wife stayed overnight in this property on the occasion of my birthday. we had a dinner booking in Mashaal dining and 1 night stay with breakfast.  The Dining experience when it comes to food was okayish but the price we were charged was on a higher side. I honestly feel i could get better experience in much less price in other places.The taste was above average and the service was super slow. The good thing however was the way we were being treated by Restaurant Manager Amit and our Butler Jitendra. Both these guys were amazing when it comes to hospitality.  The check in process was smooth and the rooms were big, Clean and comfortable.  The breakfast spread was nothing too special however the Food was great. everything that we tasted was great except Chicken Sausages which have some room to improve.  Again the Manager Amit took care of us at the time of breakfast as well..  Overall it was a great experience and i might visit this place again if the prices are reasonable.
I visited the place for dinner with my family at around 8.30-9 pm on a Sunday and the place was mostly empty with I think 3 more tables being served. The place has ample of sitting and serves both buffet as well as a-la-carte. The outlet is extremely overpriced considering the taste and the portions of the food served. The staff although courteous and ready to serve is slow in service and forgetful of basic things like finger bowls after the meal. In my opinion the outlet may be suited for just buffet brunches and not for family dinner , Paranda located in the same property would be my recommendation if you wish to have a good family dinner. The food is average at best and nothing stands out be it the dal or the paneer or even soups. The only item I liked was the pasta(refer the image attached because I am not exactly sure of the name of the dish as my brother has ordered it ) which had a nice presentation as well as great taste. The outlet feels more like an obligation of the management rather than a genuine attempt by the property to serve good food to guests. I would like to reiterate that the service was slow but the staff serving out table was very nice and friendly. I even had a chat with the manager of the property after the dinner who explained to me that outlet can be termed as more of a cafe rather than a restaurant per se and they do actually provide finger bowls after the meal (but in my case they did not) and that he will look into as to why the service was slow.  To summarize : Visit Paranda for dinner and Oasis maybe for a Sunday brunch as this outlet is definitely overpriced with mediocre food whereas Paranda more than justifies it prices with taste and ambiance.
Tried the buffet breakfast while staying at this property.  Food quality and taste was good.  Variety was as you would expect from a 5 star buffet.  Ambience of the restaurant is great and it offers a nice view to the courtyardüòÄ  Staff is courteous and service is quick.  However, the breakfast was wrapped up within minutes post 10:30 AM without giving us a heads up.  They did try to make up for it though by offering us various items which were possible at their end post breakfastüëç

Amazing food and an amazing service Its always a pleasure to be here.
If it‚Äôs a 2/3 star rated hotel then the service at restaurant is acceptable but if this property claims to b 5 star then it‚Äôs pathetic, staff running helter-skelter patrons waiting Staff training urgently required used plates hav to b removed before serving next course but probably they hav this dhaba mentality Needs gross overhaul till then a Big No, One is bound to have better professional service at less rated places
Amazing experience!! Best thing I loved about the place is the service, they were fulfilling my every wish. Only place in faridabad where the customer is actually being heard. Place is beautiful with an authentic punjabi style ambience in addition to the luxuries of a 5 star. I specifically asked for low spicy food as my wife was not well but still everything was delicious including the Tamatar dhaniya shorba. Although the shahi khumbh I ordered was little undercooked but the tasty gravy made it still so delicious. Overall it was a great experience.
""
Ambience is quite good. Staff members are very professional. Quality and taste of the food is awesome. Specially the grilled soya chaps, one of the best I ever had. I would recommend this place to the food lovers. And Yes if you are a Gold Member a dish is free for you here.
The good place for visit and literally not so worth it as I was expecting overall a good place for visit and want more better I hope they will do it soon!
Fresh, yum and just the right amount of sweet. I thoroughly enjoyed the Tiramisu served in a champagne glass with a crunchy wafer on the side. An amazing blend of coffee and bailies Irish cream - by far the best I have had in NCR. Must try! the poolside ambience with birds in the roof is unique and worth the drive from Delhi. Go for it !
Simply amazing The pastry are always love. They were soft, moist and flavoirful. Ordered hazelnut pastry, got a perfect onee with crunchy nuts inside. Always ready for a good pastry at Tado !!
This is a small bakery in the Vivanta by Taj Hotel. They have delicious pastries and cakes. We had chicken patty & chicken quiche. I simply loved both the items. I had Chicken quiche for the first time, it‚Äôs a tart with chicken in it. Very tasty. It‚Äôs quality is really nice. They have a small sitting just in front of this small bakery. Good place for a quick snack
A cute cafe in Vivanta with a really beautiful seating. One can gorge on their delicious and fulfilling shakes, along with a variety of snacks! I ordered strawberry milkshake and chicken quiche, both of them were mind blowing!
Nope

Its vry oily food and not well cooked
Quality is really nice and I liked the taste but price was fine before nowadays price also on peak which is really disappointed me a lot! Could be more better experience!
I ordered first time from this restaurant and they this type of very over oily and salty food that leave human animals can't it zomato cheated me twice in a day so I have to uninstall this worst app.

It was my first visit to Banjara. The decor was cool. Staff seemed to be polite and caring. I thought there would be more varieties in buffet but there were hardly 3 varieties of vegetables and one non veg item. I liked the taste. Sea food is not available as there are no demands for prawns or any other sea food item. Will visit again to taste items from main menu which available on a la carte basis. Over all I would like to give it an another try
The food was here is really nice and also loved the ambience! Had an amazing day surely recommend! But drinks were average and services were slow
Go on your own RISK.  Visit date : 29 June 19  The restaurant is an open hall area with no close doors , we felt hot and requested to check their aircon. They did n reverted its all good.  A short light cut and boom no AC. All we‚Äôre sweating ‚Äòliterally‚Äô incl staff. Now they gave excuse that our air con takes time to start after electricity cut (however that didn‚Äôt happen for next 1 hr or so)  Anyways, that was something not in control of restro staff. After getting 2 starters, 3rd one didn‚Äôt come for 15 mins. We asked to cancel n serve main course but request declined. Then the worst thing - We were served ROTTEN CHICKEN. It was smelling so bad, probably their fridges are not working but that‚Äôs isnt excuse to serve such filthy food !  After the torture in heat and waste food, we hoped for an explanation on rotten food.  A general staff was termed as manager (he wasn‚Äôt the manager), he then called security managerüòÇ who didnt knew what is rotten chicken .  It‚Äôs a total fail restaurant and Very RISKY to eat here.   Stay safe and avoid this

I ordered chicken biryani and egg roll food was good , quality was good but quantity is little less than expected,üëåüëå recommended good taste
Very very very bad yaar had hai 3baje ka time h online order karne ka aur agar ek minute bhi late ho gaye to close ho jata hai very bad plz zomato do something this is very big problem solve it fast
Simply awesome !! The Rolls are authentic kathi rolls with great taste & flavour. The Dada is making them since long and has mastered the art and picked-up the taste of its patrons. Must give it a try
If you are a serious kathi roll lover then i would recommend this place just for you and there is really big reason behind this which is their food. The rolls are very good in terms of freshness of the fillings and covering,and have a very unique taste that you can only experience by visiting this place.
Worst restaurant i dont why are they in the market . Dukaan ka shuttrr maar or band krdo .hsusysvwgwbwusgs6sgsjsbhsusysbslsbsusbshisbsjsmsksgsbsbsj
I am pasta lover and I have tried white sauce pasta from this restaurant and frankly speaking I am in love with the pasta . Amazing taste with great service.
I was tasted here some delicious items and it was good in a taste and the quality and quantity of items was outstanding and I taste here pasta.  ALFREDO PASTA MAC AND CHEESE PASTA.  These two pasta was outstanding in a taste and it's one of my favorite pasta is there and the quantity of pasta was very good.
Saturday night I was in faridabad with my friends , we all were there for some get together , we decided to visit a restaurant Called CHEESE AND MORE. They have variety of Italian food , we ordered few things , Exotic Veg pizza , Mix Sause pasta and garlic bread , all times was phenomenal , exotic pizza and Mix sause pasta was superb , pizza was loaded with cheese , bell peppers , black olives and other veggies , mix sause pasta was thick and creamy , and rich with veggies penne pasta was properly bowled and cooked. Garlic bread was also good , taste and aroma of food was perfect , food was warm till the end , service was fast , neat and clean , ambience was also good.
Looking for a hangout restaurant in charmwood the do consider cheese and more the kitchen. This restaurant is perfect place for This. I went there yesterday with my classmates. The ambiance is very beautiful and gorgeous. The staff is very cooperative. The food is delicious too. We had some pasta and pizza namly Alfredo pasta and cheese Burst pizza. They were delicious I must say. Planning to visit again soon.
Cheese and more in charmwood Faridabad is a very famous restaurant and i usually visit here. A few days ago i visited here with my friends and we had a great time there.

Very bad taste of White Sauce Pasta and was delivered cold.The vegetables were not boiled properly and i regret that i ordered from this restaurant.
Their burger is amazing..n deserve a 5 star rating..but the sitting space is too small along with it feel humid inside the space...delivery time is little bit more even for places nearby the restro..
didnt taste good.. the chicken was undercooked
Terrible service you guys always deliver the wrong order. Even when things are very specificed. Asked for the swipe machine twice did not get it even once,quit pizza street forever.

I ordered , paneer jaipuri, Mix veg, rice and roti for lunch today. It was the first time i placed order from Spice wok. I must say food quality and quantity¬† was awesome. I never expected such kind of awesome food in my locality.¬† Must recommended ..
#good and peacefully place to dine out with your family and friends. #tasty food at nominal price. #good environment to sit back and wait for the order.

All time favorite masala dosa of btw. It have a dilicious taste.and the environment of btw is vry gud
""
We usually order chole bhature from btw, but quality of bhatura is not good for having at home. They're usually like rubber. Was looking for gajar halwa for long. So ordered it from here along with moong dal halwa. Pathetic quality. Not tasty at all. The moong halwa is made of moong powder probably, and not soaked, ground moong dal. Will try Haldiram next. Expensive but quality assured.
""
PIZZA and PASTA are two things for which I can give anything. This place is the most trust worthy for the Italian taste. Its not like the other joint which they are serving on the name of Italian.¬† Must try red sauce pasta and chicken tikka pizza from slice of itlay.
I have tried many pizza joints and finally bored from them. Main reason that the quality and the making process does not meet my expectation. Finally reached to their outlet and want to confess why I have not come earlier to them. Their butter chicken pizza is just mouth watering.
Yummmmmmmy
Order 12 nch large chake de phattepizza I had the fillings of melted cheese tomato onion capsicum pepper and the cheesy and yummy taste still attracts my mind....overall it was perfect ordered soon.
I want to eat something yummy and delicious so i ordered salad in bun from this outlet....because i never had this interesting salad bun....this was my first food from this outlet....delivery on time...packing too good and the taste it was so yummy.

I really love Domino pizza and garlic bread is best.

Domino's is the best place to eat pizza, and the Dominos here is quite good. The cleanliness is very good, the service is good. Veg loaded pizza,onion pizza, capcicum pizza and burger pizza all these pizzas I have eaten and this is my favorite.

Love the starvin marvin food. It‚Äôs good for all the late night food lovers. I‚Äôve ordered a pizza from there it was thin crust and good one. Keep up the great work guys! üëçüèª‚ô•Ô∏è
Ordered burgers for the 3rd time. The first time their burgers were damn good. Medium rare and such succulent and flavorful patties. Amazing burgers.  But this time over cooked patties for both tender loin and mutton. Way too much well done and patties had very less flavors. It was very bland.  Tenderloin was ruined beyond repairs. I couldn't finish it. I had loved their burgers from my first order but now the quality has gone really down.  I don't think I can order again. Please work on getting back same quality you had 2 months back.  Cheers.
Hi, I placed an order on Diwali. Not only did you guys not deliver the order, but the money has still not been refunded till date. It has been three weeks now. I have given feedback on your app for the order as well as called multiple times. But no response. I used to like this place but very very disappointed with this experience.
I'm a big fan of the Starvin' Marvin at Okhla, their food never disappoints. On the other hand, this place always does. You'll order something, they'll send something else.  They sent me a burnt black rock of a brownie covered in cheap chocolate sauce when I had ordered a banoffie pie. It was hard enough to break the spoon and there is no way they didn't they didn't see how burnt it was before packing it.  Their food sucks, no proper portion, quantity or quality it's dry and tasteless. Order the same thing from the Starvin' Marvin at Okhla and you'll be shocked how good they make it and how carelessly and intentionally these guys make it all suck.  They can't even make mashed potatoes so they send aloo ki sabzi instead. The one at Okhla has bigger portions, fresher food and great service.  In jasola, from packing to cooking to customer satisfaction this place sucks and should be shut down before they end up poisoning someone.
Absolutely the worst customer service ever. I had ordered once before with my friends late night and took 2.5 hours to deliver and today it took 2 hours to deliver and no one picks up the phone as well. It was an extremely irritating experience for me. Although the food is decent I have always been disappointed with their customer service.
"I have visited this place multiple times, especially during lunch breaks as it is near to my office. But I feel that the menu is overpriced vis-a-vis the taste and quality of food served.  Today I ordered in ""chicken alfredo pasta"" to my office (through zomato). But as soon as I opened the package, stale scent hit my nostrils. Even though the pasta looked fine and tasted okay, the smell was disturbing. It seemed as if either the cheese or chicken pieces weren't fresh. And I had paid RS. 336 for the same. Highly disappointed. Just hoping I don't upset my stomach!"
the staff were friendly . But the food wasn't upto the mark. Only the shakes tasted well. I think they need to work upon the taste of food
The most overrated place I have ever seen. Many people recommended me this place and I really didn‚Äôt like it. The only good things were it‚Äôs shakes. I ordered chilli potatoes and they were the weirdest chilli potato‚Äôs of my life. The lasagne was average. And the baked nachos had beans vegetable in it instead of kidney beans and I was left confused. #dontgo #badplace
I ordered a large pizza, it was ice cold, club sandwich was not fresh at all and the aam panna was made out of some cheap chemicals. Really disappointed with the service. My home is not far away from this place still the order was cold.
I ordered veg combo and non veg combo. The food was oily, unhealthy, pathetic and sheer waste of money. Rice was half cooked, paratha was cold and the gravy had more oil than other content. The non veg gravy had only three small pieces of chicken. Similarly, veg gravy had three small pieces of paneer. What a waste of money.

Moti Mahal is one of my favorite restaurants period. The food is always delicious and the service is always kind. The price is always reasonable as far as the food goes. The tandoori chicken is so tender and rightly spiced too, the butter chicken is so delicious and creamy as well.
With my family I recent went to Moti Mahal and this place is really great and nice cosy ambiance.¬† From starter to main course each dishes were so good and nicely presented. I will be back here again and again. Humble staff and quick service.
Food was good enjoyed it with family
A place is having two restaurant one is Moti Mahal and other is King's Polo Lounge. Nice ambiance and well decorated. For a family dinner this place is worth the visit. I went with my family and had a great dinner here. Nice and humble staff. Love this place.
I have had the most harrowing experience of this place. Last Saturday happened to consume a vegetable patty at their place and post that encountered my worst ever food poisoning . I haven't yet recovered in four days! The product was cold and am sure infected which they dont agree to! Also the same is outsourced to a vendor with no quality checks. The shop is left in the hands of care takers and no owner to be seen or approached for raising issues. Please beware of these outlets else suffer like me!
Just thankyou soooooo muchüôÇüôÇ

The cake was ruined in delivery and the quote I asked them to write on the cake was also missing leaving us completely disappointed.

The food was stale and smelly. Disgusting experience. The food containers were smelly too and the cutlery provided wasn‚Äôt fresh. Looked used and old
Good place to have food ...very nice taste mild and authentic . Nice dishes and very good staff.
Decent place to dine with family or get together. Very little crowded with good food and good music . Service was a little slow but our table attendant was very courteous and humble. Ambience was also soothing here.   What to try: Palak patta chaat  Honey chilli potato and lotus stem Mint mojito Cheese cake ( a little hard though) Veg clear soup  Main course and other soups  were average here.
Excellent visit and loved the ambience and food too they serve yummiest non veg and as well as great services. Nice experience surely recommend!
Chawla-chicken.com is an apt place to have north indian, mughlai and chinese food. Ordered paneer butter masala with tandoori rotis. Ordered at my doorstep in estmated time.packaging was upto the mark. Decent prices and apt quantity.
Awesome food.great taste..and the service is good..The staff are really polite..there recipes are lip licking.i have visited this place several times amd chicken biryani is my absolute favorite.
Are you a chicken lover. If yes then this is the place for you. There is no second choice. The best part is they cook so perfectly, its just finger licking good. I must say everyone should try it once. The rate list is appropriate and delivery is perfect. So thumbs up.
One of my favourite places to order North Indian food from. I love the fact that the delivery is always made on time and the food is delivered hot and fresh. I usually order the tandoori chicken , kadai chicken and butter naan. The food is delicious and the spices are blended perfectly.  Highly recommended!!
I recently ordered Butter Chicken and Dal Making from this place and it was so tasty. The package was hygienic and presentable, good was hot and fresh. This place is amazing you must try!

It's a great place for all roll lovers. Recently I ordered a chicken double egg roll and that was amazing. The taste of chicken and its texture was as a foodie expert. The base of the roll had a unique flavor. I love their packaging, it kept the food hot.

What makes a excellent buffet is food combined with an urge to visit once more: Variety of Food , Food Quality , taste , Pricing ( we got 1+1 deal ) , Seating Comfort , Service , Bite Size  Caf√© on 3 fulfills all the requirements 100%  To name a few dishes were rogan josh , cheese and Corn Samosa , Grilled fish , Tandoori Chicken , Dal makhani ‚Ä¶ deserts ( not to miss Strawberry ice ‚Äì cream . it had real strawberries ) cakes , indian mithai ‚Ä¶.  Chef R Chauhan ( Rajender Chauhan )personally visited to take feedback ‚Ä¶.infact he made us try their keema pao , patisa  , gajar ka halwa all specially made . though they were not a part of their menu but since it was lori so welcome gesture and we really liked it  Golgappa had filling of mashed potato ( sounds different but tastes so good , infact changed the dimension ) . Rogan josh was so well cooked that the meat was falling off the bone instantly upon picking up . Perfect mix and match of salt and spices , not too bland not spicy . All these things make food delectable and enhances the taste bud   Overall a very good experience  Plus they are running 4 festivals back to back in the month of January, 2020 ( all for Dinner ) . Time to taste the delicacies and experience the offer
Great Place to chill out with friends and family. nice hospitality with good food. enjoyed the hospitality of swadheen and kaif.
Writing this review sitting in the restaurant and waiting for the service. They almost are clueless about service. Don't have much variety in their buffet spread and not worth the money they are charging.  Naam bade darshan chote
You will be tempted to go to this restaurant by looking at the ratings that this place has. I was tempted too but the ratings just did not justify the restaurant. Hence, it made me believe that the ratings here are paid ones. I have given one star for good customer service as that's the only thing that this place has to offer. So, if you talk about food : Starters - There were only 4 starters , 2 Indian and 2 Chinese. All 4 of them were fried starters.  Main course - decent options but I certainly did not came here to eat multiple items of main course. I (or anyone else also) can't have chicken curry , Rogan gosh , so many vegetables.  Desserts - average taste  Overall not recommended at all. Will never go to this restaurant again.  Restaurant manager and chef had courtesy to take a follow up on the feedback given in the restaurant. Staff was good.
Wont friggin lay even Re.10 for this atrocity of a burger that they call call tenderloin cheese burger.......Even a mcdonalds mcgrill is better than this.
As this is a delivery only restaurant I ordered Premium Biryani Combo and it was so delicious. The delivery was on time. Packaging was presentable and hygenic, food was hot and fresh. Prices were reasonable.
The briyani was delicious had a good taste. The quality and quantity was good . It looked fresh. It was pockete Friendly and had an excellent service.
Tried chicken biryani and chicken dum biryani. Loved the on time delivery. Quality was superp. Delivered on time. I recommend this brand. Prices are affordable
I got delivered paneer dum Biryani from this outlet, i genuinely loved the taste. It was just so amazing. Paneer pieces were very big and were baked nicely. Also biryani had lots of veggies and quality of rice was nice too. Overall amazing taste and good food.
Got a delivery for what it is famous for, Biryani! Chicken 65 biryani was my choice of the day and I enjoyed having the biryani to the fullest. It had good quantity of rice and chicken too. The pieces were succulent and a treat to hog on. Got it on time and fresh.

this place has a good ambience and generous staff. Lucky served us a perfect meal and recommended us what to choose and seriously guyz ! it was perfect.we ordered dungar paneer and bistro biryani with wholewheat roti. it was delicious and we are looking forward to explore other option available on their menu.
Ordered food was very delicious and best part was that restaurant has prepared food as per instructions. Delivery before time is customer delight
I ordered Makki ke roti and saag combo for the team lunch and everyone loved it so much. In my experience, usually, the bulk order loses its quality due to bulk preparation or delivery time, but this wasn't the case this time. Makki ke roti was soft and saag was full of flavor. Thanks, guys for a delicious serving
Baa Bistro is probably the best place in the locality for a vegetarian meal. I recently visited their outlet in Mayur Vihar and was pretty amused by the food they had. They had pretty great ambience with glimpse of rajasthani theme. The staff there were very polite and had great recommendations. They helped me a lot to select from the wide menu that the place offers. I had :  Tandoori kebab platter : 4/5 This had paneer tikka, dahi ke sholey, bhutteyan de kabab and tandoori soya chaap. It was served with green chutney and onions on the side. Everything on this platter was great!  Honey chilli potato : 4.5/5 Crispy chilly potatoes cooked nicely in red gravy with onion and capsicum. It was topped with sesame seeds and had an amazing taste. This was sufficient for two people.  Spring Rolls : 4/5 It was filled with cabbage, onion and a variety of sauces. It was served with a red hot chutney on its side. It had a great taste.  Oreo shake : 5/5 Thick shake with loads of Oreo crunches. Do try this shake for ab awesome experience.  Chocolate shake : 4/5 Great shake with a decent amount of chocolate in it. The presentation was nice too.  Gajar ka halwa : 4.5/5 This was a nice dessert with loads of dry fruits in it. It was topped with cashews on top and had the perfect amount of sweetness. The extra raisins in the middle increased it's taste.  Overall, this was a nice place to hangout with friends. If you're around this locality, do visit this place and you i can assure you that you won't be disappointed.  Food : 5/5 Service : 5/5 Ambience : 4.5/5
If you are looking for best Asian food... It's best place to hangout with friends ND family ...
Visited this place on a casual Weekday afternoon and a weekend night. The food is simply impeccable and served fresh. If one's craving mainstream Chinese food, most things on the menu may seem unrecognizable but surely deserve a try. The menu is well curated which serves as an adventure for both Vegetarians and Non vegetarians.¬†  As a vegetarian, I quite liked Clay pot Vegetables, Vegetable Dumpling in sesame chilli soya sauce and the old Vegetable stir fried noodles. The tranquil and chic environment will help, as you wait for your food to arrive.

If you are looking for authentic Asian flavors and have some money to spare, this is the place to go to! It is a fine dining restaurant, so it was very quiet, which appeared a little intimidating sometimes. The service was good.  Coming onto the food, we ordered sushi, pan fried noodles with lo han vegetables in garlic sauce, and the teppanyaki meal containing tofu and bean sprouts. The noodles were nothing special, however the vegetables complemented them perfectly and made the dish pretty good. The tofu was crunchy outside and melted in your mouth on taking a bite. The bean sprouts went along with it quite well. Along with sticky rice, this dish was perfect. I did not try the sushi, but I heard it was quite good as well. Moving on to the desserts, we had the green tea creme brulee. It was unique and interesting, but I would not try it again. The trio of ice cream on the other hand, also had very unique flavors but it tasted quite good. The star anise ice cream was the clear favourite.  Since we had a 50% discount, the food was quite affordable. However, the rates are on the higher side. If you can afford it, by all means, go ahead. The taste and quality of food makes up for it!
Following are the dishes I must recommend from dhaba eat inn: Hakka noodle Egg curry Chicken tikka roll Mutton masala kadhai chicken . Perfect indian style spicy food they deliver. Menu is vast and offer various options in veg and non veg.
I have tried their malai chicken tikka and kadhai chicken. Malai chicken was creamy and have a special spices and herbs. I suggest you to try this. Kadhai chicken was spicy and have a lots of a Capsicum and onions which make it special.
Best tandoori chicken available in Sector 7, Noida. I ordered tandoori chicken and fried rice. Tandoori chicken was too good and super delicious. The fried rice were perfectly cooked and came hot and fresh. The essence tandoor was too good in tandoori chicken. Totally worth the money and as it came on time with Zomato fast delivery. Must order from Dhaba Eat Inn located in Sector 7, Noida.
I got delivered with their special chicken malai tikka and kadhai chicken. Tikka was amazing. I highly recommend this. Malai gravy was so smooth and spicy that I won't able to resist . Kadhai chicken was spicy and have a thick consistency.
I got delivered with fish tikka and drums of heaven. Fish tikka was juicy and fish was perfectly cooked and marinated with amazing flavors. Drums was spicy and I really like it. I highly recommend this outlet. They have plenty of options for vegetarians too.
We went there to celebrate the wedding anniversary of my brother. Located at Mayur Vihar Phase 1, New Delhi.¬†  Ambiance - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  Staff & Service - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  **According to Price**  Quantity - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  Taste -‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  Quality - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  Overall - Infinity has one of the best buffets to offer. It is a perfect place to go to with your family, loved ones and with your friends.  The ambiance is awesome. The interiors of Infinity are classy and good-looking. Wooden finishes are used on the ceiling and on walls, giving the room a welcoming warmth. The room is well-lit and is quite elegant to look at.  We started off with some soup and non-veg starters. They were really nice. Non-Veg starters were limited in comparison with Veg starters. The salads were also good. The main course was also good, spices were blended properly in both the main course dishes. Finally, desserts. Frankly, the desserts were not that good. But the Gulab Jamun took away all my disappointment. It was soo delicious and soft.¬†¬†  The staff and service were good. The staff was friendly.¬†  Overall, a really good experience. It had a limited menu but the main focus was the experience and the flavour.
Cozy Place to spend a good time with friends or with your family. Don't opt for Pizza üçï better go with other starter. Veg and Non Veg maincourse both were Yummy. Dessert were not so good, there bases were too hard and didn't looked fresh. Fruits was good.
As it was the weekday, very less people were there still the service was dead slow and the buffet time was very limited. Food tasted very bad. Didn't expect this. Won't recommend.
Duty Manager says that you only get 1 hour to finish your coffee in an empty coffeeshop. Either re-order or wait outside!! AMAZING SERVICE!!
We had lunch at the restaurant. We liked the ambience of the hotel and the restaurant. Food wise - salads, paneer labandar, Mexican fish and noodles were good. Desserts were also good, especially mal pua. Pizza and pasta are avoidable; will request the restaurant to either improve their quality or stop serving sub-standard stuff.  Staff was polite and courteous. Overall a good experience.
""
I ordered 3 pizza mania and two garlic breads one stuffed and the other one normal. The food was good overall. i didn't like the taste of onion pizza so i would not prefer that in future. Otherwise stuffed garlic bread and stuff are great.

A thali combined with three different veggies, veg raita, and fried rice. How incredible it is in such a low price. I don‚Äôt have to think twice if I have to eat full north Indian meal.
Foodelicious Special , i had ordered . we are so testy and yummy . I like this services. This place online food delivery by zomato.
The delivery was also fast. In short,it was totally worth the price and a must try :) The food was delicious. I loved the packing. The portion size was just as I need it to be.
Not only was the food amazing but the delivery was on time. The price was also very reasonable . Along with this, the food options were very interesting.
Loved the taste and place so much.. I denied cooking so my husband ordered online. It was good combination of tomato soup The food was really nice with delicious spices bursting in mouth. The quantity was more than enough for us.

I was very hungry but the Quantity is very low. I ordered it for Rs 285 but quality is also that good enough. I recommed Not to order form it. Thanks.
Ordered 7 Rumali Rotis & Full Tandoori Chicken but received only 3 Rumali Rotis. This clearly shows how the restaurant is conning people by not delivery the orders despite of getting the payment. Highly disappointed as even after raising this concern with the restaurant the concerned people are not even bothered to take up this issue. Will not recommend to anyone...!
When it comes to mean and decadent burgers,MOC . is the go to place for munching. Within a short span of time, this burger joint has made a name for itself in the Indian market¬† suited to the Indian palate¬† they provide a really nice service worth a visit .
Recently I went to MOC restaurant with my friends. There I ordered chicken grilled peri-peri burger, moc rock burger and chicken burger both the burgers were amazing. The taste was super good. They were so crispy and there was an adequate amount of spice and sauces. The best one was the peri-peri chicken burger and moc burger. All the dishes were at a reasonable price. The ambience was great. Overall my experience was amazing I would surely revisit it again.
MOC is surely one of my favourites when it comes to Chicken. Chicken Wings rice bowl along with Chicken Popcorn and Pepsi is just amazing. Taste is really good , quantity is also nice and delivery is also fast.¬† Also try MOC Rock Burger and Paneer Salsa Burger. They are delicious and filling as well.
""
Best burger joint.

Love it

I order pizza and pasta the food is very good and I happy to eat
Nothing to be aadd this place is very good and his quality of pizza burger and sandwich is very good
Ordered a paneer roll today. It was bad! Literlly just a roti and paneer filling in it. No layering, no texture, no work. Simple roti and just paneer sabzi filling. Money waste to be honest
I order regularly from faasos, to be honest rolls are very good and delivery is also fast.
"I am a regular customer of faasos.Delivery is always good and fast.Rolls are good,Deserts are nice ,Aloo pratha is a big ""NO"""

Such a horrible experience.. I strongly recommend you people not to go for anything with this restaurant..

Baked Buns apparently are the only folks in town not aware of the fact that a sandwich has 2 halves. Their sandwich and fries box had just one slice of sandwich, ungrilled, with 10-12 fries. Price was Rs 83.
They served the worst pizza I have ever had. The Paneer corn pizza costed me over ‚Çπ200 and it was nothing but a rip-off. The crust was as burnt and hard as something made on the stove, the toppings were dumb and the cheese was literally dead. Never recommending them to anyone I know, atleast for pizzas.
I have eaten ovenstory pizza before as well and thought they have really good pizzas, I ordered Maharaja Pizza, but the biggest disappointment is when you are hungry and you think something best however received the worst pizza on that!!! Abhi tak ka sabse bakwas pizza! Roti pe topping krke de di! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ ab itni raat me milk bread kha raha hoon. Pata nhi kab ka pizza bheja hoga! To add on, no direct call support or any outlet no. to change it. I don't have option to star 0....
Yeh to next level c*#apa hai......i wasted my 500 bucks on a pizza that tasted lika a bitter gourd...god knows what ingredient they use however there was something that made the taste awfully bitter
I ordered the pizza and is was just a squishy and sticky pizza, the worst base of any Pizza I have ever had. The garlic bread has too much sauce/masala at some places and totally bland at others. Plus the prices are just too high and it is simply NOT WORTH IT..
""
""
Order food from the restaurant and wrong food supply by them and after calling back to them they was reluctant to correct their mistake after sending the wrong order.
I ordered bedmi poori several times from this outlet but from last 2 times there were no proper salad given neither onions nor pickel otherwise taste was quiet good :)
The packing, freshness of the raj kachori. For that i will give 5/5. But the price was a bit high. The taste of the yogurt....j am in love with thatüòç. The stuffing of the raj kachori includes corn, paneer, namkeen, papdi and everything was fresh. Try it once
Ambience is ok.staff is really good and food is also good but price's are on higher side for what we are getting!

There is no egg n chicken in the non veg noodles... Stupid... Last order
Shitty people cant deliver the food but can make 10000 excuses Just like their shitty service they have shitty people as well who dont know how to talk Mannerless losers
Adequate and ok!!
Don't order from this place if you want to crub your midnight hunger. There is no taste left in the food. Even the chef special items are dissapointing. It used to be good but now the quality has really degraded.

Ordered chicken burger, chicken fried rice and egg fried rice ..Delivery was done on time..Packing was done properly ..But the burger was horrible..It was too soft with loads of creams and was tasteless..In addition, Eating the fried rice made me repeatedly console my mind that it is fried rice , it was completely TASTELESS..I wouldn't recommend anyone to order from here..
""
This place is nearby ‚ô•Ô∏è I just love their veg burger üí´ Staff is humble , quality is upto the mark . Quite hygienic üíØ
Great place to eat food with elegant ambiance.¬† Insane food and the staff is very well trained.Great value for money as well. Highly recommend!!!

The food was absolutely bad. The nachos were burnt, burger was extremely soggy and the the wrap was the worst I've ever had. It had a bad smelling oil which totally ruined my appetite. Not ordering anything from here again
I tell you, they have degraded in terms of quality and taste both. I have been ordering from them since last 3-4 years and the authenticity and quality they used to offer is completely missing now.¬† Shawrma, Creamy Bruschetta, Pannini were my favorites. All of them taste very different (and not good different) now.¬†  Taste: 2/5   Services : 3/5  Ambiance : 3/5  Staff : 3/5  Prices - Average as well
Ordered a Margherita pizza, which was mentioned to be thin crust. Delivery was in time with hot pizza, flavours was awesome. But the crust was not thin but like simple regular one. Still the flavours were way better than popular pizza brands.
Loved the place Very reasonable , tasty food Would love to visit again . Beautiful presentation amazing service.

Domino's is my favorite when it comes to pizzas. The taste of their pizzas is literally too good plus they never compromise in quality. I love all the variety of their pizzas.
""
Dominos is serving its customer since past many years all over the world. They have maintained their quality and taste perfectly and amazingly. I have tried almost all items from their menu and always love to eat from its outlets. Yesterday I ordered one of my favorite medium size Paneer tikka cheese burst pizza along with stuffed garlic bread. The taste was very good. The staff was polite and the proper hygiene was maintained.
Crispy chicken roll is the best thing I liked here. It is rightly cooked and spices are moderate. The chicken keema naam was not up to the mark, very less chicken was there in the naam.
I have ordered tandoori chicken and that food is totally burned unable to eat after complaint didn't get any response from restaurant..
A nice place to gorge on the delicious chicken.. both dry and gravy.. also rolls and biryani will give them a competition.. yummiest food üòã (sometimes I didn't like their Afghani chicken..only sometimes) #nazeer #chicken #mutton #nonveg #veg #dry #gravy #food #foodie
i went vinod nagar nazeer i order mutton¬† korma takatak roll¬† lolly pop foods was very testy and service was fast , staff was very very fast service

"The cheesy shouldn't have been mentioned in the name at the first place. Anyone who is planning to get this i would suggest you better not because even a bread butter tastes more cheesy than this. And the restaurant doesn't even accept that even normal garlic bread have more cheese than their ""cheesy"" garlic bread. Worst services. And worst cheese distribution."
Like other outlets this outlet is also serving fresh and good food. They have really tasty snacks for us with beautiful ambience. The staff is very knowledgeable and good in communication. You must give this place a chance.
""
I ordered a calzone and penne spinacio pasta and spaghetti, the food is tasty and i can feel that it is living upto the standard of slice of Italy!
I ordered a calzone and tiramisu.. they don‚Äôt even know what these dishes are and have just used the names of dishes. Not at all worthy. Tiramisu was really pathetic, normal ice cream would have been much better than it.

There paneer butter Masala and dal makhni is good but as compared to other outlets in shahdara there quality and quantity is not Up to the Mark
I was there with my friends. I must say food was good . With wide variety of food and friendly staff
I had ordered rajma chawal and rajma masala recently.But you had given me two rajma chawal bowls and no rajma masala. What is the meaning of early delivery of orders if you are not delivering the appropriate food. Thats the most disgusting and pathetic food I ever eat in comparison to other restaurants.
Chap quality too bad, very sweet and even not got got any salad, not enjoyed the food at all..................................................
Hira sweets is one of the largest chain which is providing best quality of sweets all over the Delhi with amazing and mouth watering taste. The prices of hiralal sweets is normal and affordable with the best quality. Gulab jamun malpua many other more things are really special and good at this place.

I ordered their thali. Thali was delicious and tasty and best part it had different variety of breads such as naan, parantha and missi roti.
They make good Dal Makhni but their Paneer dishes are pretty inconsistent.  If you are lucky, then you might get to taste good dishes.  For a place where you have to depend on your luck, it is not affordable enough.
Increased Price for every item and stop giving onions and chutney Even Requested but then as well¬† Really Shameful!! A Restaurant does not deserve to do this even roadside give ample amount of salad and chutney
The worst biryani i ever had literally. Suggest you guys to not order chicken biryani from here. 1/5

Amazing food
quality is good, worth for money
I loved pudina paneer tikka...received it on time and hot. But it had more onions and tomatoes than paneer. Quantity should be more. Otherwise it was delicious.

Good and fresh amazing taste
My mom was not home and I was too lazy to cook for myself. I searched and found this pocket-friendly outlet with a few good reviews that compelled me to try this place. The rolls in the menu seems to be tempting, and there is a wide list of items to choose from. I would recommend you to try:  Paneer tikka roll Afgani chaap roll  The potion size served was good. I am gonna surely order again from this place.
Had ordered from the place after being recommend by my friend and he asked me to order their PANEER ROLLS MALAI CHAAP ROLL AND CHAAP TADKA FRIED RICE Chaap rolls tasted good and rice were bit spicy. I am surely gonna order it again whenever i got cravings. Moreover the packaging was good (not extraordinary or fancy one) but it was good enough to prevent spoilage and I was totally satisfied with the delievery time kudoos to the place
I ordered malai chaap and rumali roti Malai Chaap - its was too yummy and delicious and creamy also with some masaledaar also and rumali roti was a soft overall Taste was awesome Delivery on time Service was good
I ordered Yellow Dal Punjabi Tadka and Paneer Butter Masala from Janak Puri. Quality: Dal - 4 stars¬† Paneer - 3 stars Quantity: it was fine. Value: it was bit high than the food served.  So will try something else in Veg very soon to upgrade my rating.
Bought half a kilo of gajar ka halwa highly marketed product.Found it to be extremely average without any dry fruits and even no deshi ghee.very sad.

The service was really quick and the crowd management was great Do try the whooper range, complete meal is sufficient for a single person The shakes were amazing

Went their to celebrate my friends anniversary yesterday. Food quality in last few months have seriously deteriorated. Request you to improve as you guys were best at one time and I always use to relish my visit to Barbeque Nation. You have a brand to protect and it does not take much time in today's competitive world to go out of business if you don't cope with competitors.
Service & food quality has gone down significantly. None of the items were upto the mark. Considering Barbeque Nation as a brand you should introspect & improve or atleast maintain your quality.
I have visited today to check that what BBN serve/provide to their customers. I have started with starters (non veg) and all were good. I did not like the main course options and meat balls were too hard. Barbeque company, jail road comparatively better option to opt for buffet what I believe.

Matki chicken is awesome. Nice place to be with family. Non veg lovers must come here. Momos are also very delecious. Lastly.. Near to metro station.
Visited three tuns with my three buddies , had a wonderful time , really enjoyed a lot , ordered many things , and really worth my money , ll positively visit three tuns again and again
Visited three tuns , unity one with my three buddiess , tried many things , the food was so yumm , and friendly staff , calm music , really loved chinese platter , which contains , orlay fish tikka , chilli chicken , chicken wings , and many more , had a wonderful experience , ll positively visit three tuns again and again
The staff if frustrating, doesn't have enough knowledge and also not corporating. I went in with zomato gold but there was no food items to eat and they have pushed us to unlock zomato gold.
Went there recently with my friends. This place has amazing interiors and quite impressive ambience. We ordered Dilli Wala Butter chicken and Tandoori rotis. Really loved the mouth watering taste and more than expected quantity. Would definitely go there again and recommend to others too.
Ordered dry rose chicken tikka, Indian style chicken Maggi and garlic bread. The food was amazing and delicious. The garlic bread has good amount of cheese in it. The chicken was perfectly cooked and amazing. The chicken Maggi was delicious and yummy. The service was good and packing was good and neatly done.

Amazing experience we had at this place Went with some friends . We ordered In veg singles onion toppings Sweet corn pizza Choco lava cake Zingy parcel . Recommended to all The cheese from each pizza was dropping
I ordered a cheese burst pizza by zomato and when i recieved it, it was all cold and spongy not even warm. And how can someone eat a cheese burst which is cool and spongy.
I go there with my friend, place was not crowded we ordered a pizza but i told them to remove mushroom from my pizza they charged extra for this so i doesn't understand this otherwise there taste is same as all time we enjoyed. #unofficialfoodie

Best malai chaap / freshly cooked / juicy / creamy / 5/5
The cashier don't have etiquettes to talk to customers. He's very rude. They want only cash payment however the have all the machines for debit or credit card. They just don't want to use those machines. They are just stupid people and they make arguments with the customers. Totally bullshit people all staff. I won't go ever again in this shittiest place ever. This is located on arya samaj road.
One of the best place to buy sweets . Recently only they started with the done in as well . The place has maintained quality standards over these years.
only the one shop in uttam nagar Specially for sweets. Sweets are good and fresh vast variety of sweets.Recently they started own restaurant.which is good and budgeted.
Awesome sweets in uttam nagar there taste od sweets and namkeen all are great specially there chole bhature and gol gappe, On every occasion we buy sweets from kali ghata due to there awesome taste and freshness of mithai . .
Wanted to try out something light so ordered kathi kebabs with roomali roti combo expecting it to be free of excess oil and spices but was disappointed by what I was presented...Over spicy and oily gravy kebabs with roomali roti that seemed more like desi ghee toasted white flour parathe....Got mallika with rabri in desert packed and it's taste also was very normal..No offence, just a genuine experience of a particular day..
""
This place has a sitting as well . Do not try chilli potato in any case . Can try for burgers . Shakes are also good .
""
Worst packaging . The taste was Yakh. They had kept the pastries in the freezer so they were watery . The chocolate layer was dancing on the watery cake . Worst
This how i got my pizza' in a ridiculous packaging even after telling them that plz send my order nicely and when i called them for the same thed told me that we cant do anything i mean seriously if uh are not taking any action then who spoose to take tge action .... Plzz don't ordered from them...
Very tasty & affordable sweets. Must try paneer jalebi

Chatni with samosa was tasty

I have been ordering food from this place for like last half an year but today when i ordered chilli potato,they were tasteless as if there is no masala or chilli in it like i m eating raw potatoes and even in pasta there is no spice or masala
""
Too expensive plus tasteless food items. Only pizza is good in taste other food items are tasteless. Not recommended if you are looking for good food items except pizza

This place is quite reasonable and decent as well . The food is quite good . They have restaurant as well as sweet shop . The taste of food is good .
its a dine in restaurant near uttam nagar east metro station provide lots of dishes in north indian as well as chinese too and they also have large variety of sweet dishes. but the service is very slow and the quality of food is also not upto the mark.
We been there with friends, we ordered chole bhature and gol gappe taste was really good of both. And they have restro area and a banquet hall with seperate area so you can book this for birthday party and anniversary party so its a grt place. #unofficial_foodies

i have ordered idli and masala dosa idli was worst and not in shape also and nariyal chatni was too full of water and packing was not good

"The food was really bland. The service was shit. Creme Brulee was runny and the toffee was very thick. When complained about the food, the waiter said, ""Yeh Life Hai."" The pizzas were undercooked and burnt. The Burger was stale."
""
We ordered grilled fish and grilled chicken with red wine jus. Both the dishes were tasty, however, the chicken arrived at a warm temperature not optimum warm or piping hot as you would expect from freshly grilled food. This leaves us wondering if the food was freshly prepared or just reheated?! The mashed potatoes were also not creamy, they were just okay.   The ambience and music were good and enough space and seating at the restaurant.   It accepts 1+1 for Zomato gold members and we had no issues using that.
This place always delivers food that achieves the embodiment of delicious and properly flavoured taste. Order many times from rooamli garh and never get disappointed.¬† Undoubtedly the best place serving Punjabi and Mughlai cuisine in Dwarka. Must try chicken tikka curry.
""
""
Having nothing to eat for lunch i thought of exploring zomato and came across a restaurant roomali garh. It was too cold outside so dont want to go outside and decided to order for home delivery. ¬†If you like to try a quality meat for reasonable price I recommend for this place for you.¬† Must try mutton curry.
In our search for great Indian food in Dwarka, we discovered roomali garh based on one of my friend recommendation. The food is incredibly delicious, high quality, and authentic. We had a mutton dish, a veggie dish and a chicken dish, along with some garlic naan. Everything was devoured. I will definitely be back to try more.
""
Very Very average food and drinks
I went to this outlet with my friends with great expectations and they didn't disappoint us.they make the best chinese food and If you have a sweet tooth ,try out their desserts. Keep Up the brilliant work.

Kebab tales is the best delivery outlet famous for their different varieties of kebabs from veg to non veg delivered at your doorstep. They provide a great service. Recently i have ordered a Paneer achari tikka which is absolutely amazing in taste and delicious. The delivery was done on time which keeps the food hot and fresh. The food was packed so well that it kept the food flavorful. I really love this place for sure. Highly recommended you to order and enjoy the meal with your friends and family from the comfort of your home.
Me and my brother ..went to his friend's place and in our lunch time..we decided to order some food for us ..so we ordered : murg makhani & murg malai tikka for us .. The food was delivered on time..and packaging was too awesome.. The malai tikka was looking ..so mouth watering ..and in the first bite ..i fell in love with it .. The murg makhani was just awesome ..as the chicken pieces was cooked very well ..and was so juicy ..The gravy was as spicy as i want .. The quantity was too sufficient for both of us .. Worth the money.. Surely recommended.. üòòüçî
Brilliant Restaurant!! Excellent food, reasonable price, great portion size, superb packing. Please do try Bhatti Da Murg and Chicken Rara. Even Chicken Curry is good. Best Restaurant in all of Dwarka Sec 10 and 6.
1. Galuati Kebab 2. Copper kebab 3. Murg Achari Tikka 4. Egg Curry 5. Plain naan Such such amazinggg place for all types of kebabsüî• Mouth watering taste & they know well how to pack thereby preserving its tasteüòç Silver sealed packets which kept food fresh and delivery was done within 30 mins.
This place is a delivery outlet not for dine-in. They represent lakhnavi, Awadhi, kebabs, and couple Mughlai dishes varying in good proportion mostly SEEKH I've ordered both Seekh, CHICKEN GILAFI It was really smooth in taste & soft as well for the usual kebab lovers including capsicum and onion taste giving it a Lil crunch makes it very much fortunate.  MALAI SEEKH It is represented as a nonspicy veg kebab made up of paneer indulged in it. Pretty good in taste for someone who is vegan.
Sweet corn soup was amazing, in main course we ordered dal tadka, kadhai paneer and malai kofta, dal tadka was fabulous, and malai kofta was awesome, mixed stuffed parantha gave a great taste with these. And their matka kulfi was just amazing. Nice cooperative staff, had great assistance while selecting our order.

Would love to come again and recommend to my friend.

Awesome place for family gatherings and couples üëç
Fine place..... provides good food bt staff is a little rude.....it has full desi kinda ambience which gives you desi vibes
Food quality and taste gone down. Ordered panner tikka the presentation was average and taste not up to the mark
""
""
Food was very delicious, service was on time and the staff is also very polite. It is the perfect place for a family dinner
Burger King is an obvious choice for burger. They have variety of burgers and every single burger has different and fantastic taste. I just get annoyed with the rush at the outlet as I have to weight for burger a lot.
This is a pretty nice outlet of burger king. The staff is really nice and speak politely. I love there burgers and order from there only.
I ordered finger fries and crispy veg burger, fries were very crispy with less oil and tikki inside the burger was very delicious and crispy. Excellent place for hang out with friends. Highly recommended.....!
So late given order 40 mins wait Very bad service

Very friendly staff. Wonderfull experience. Brijesh Sir were particularly very amiable.

"Bought a cake item ""Drocolicious cake"" and it tasted like its stale. Had to throw the whole cake. Very dissapointing experience. Caution: if they are giving you discounts like 30%-40% on cakes, most likey because its an off the shelf item."
.I left 60% of the dish
This place if you visit white sauce pasta is the best you ever had and more than enough for 2 people this is from my experience of been this place more than 5 times just for a pasta craving and it has zomato gold too so you can order their soups that are amazing too. Dont try the salad though . Dont mistake this drool with other outlets in dwarka the sector -13 is the best
Garlic Noodles üëåüëå

The menu¬† is perfect with North Indian food items and i really loved the my food i.e. north Indian. Their signature dishes forced me to try something. Their Seekh kabab is a must must have from here, perfectly minced and spicy. Tandoori chicken is another starter which I ordered. Perfectly marinated¬† the pieces just made my day. Their main course - Butter chicken was nice.. and smooth. Taste too sour to me but may be it can taste different to somebody else.  If you are craving for amazing starters in the evening, then this is the place for you!!
The food here is decent. I ordered from here for dinner meal There were a variety of selections: mutton, chicken, eggs, Vegetables, Lentils. They taste pretty good for me as a Foodie however I can't tell if they are authentic or not. Most curries/dishes are spicy, which led me to eat lots of desserts to compensate.  The place is Delivery Joint, which is better than other in same zone. However I do gave Five Spices a higher rating for the food.
Amazing taste! I‚Äôve been ordering from this outlet for quite a while now and I‚Äôve tried so many dishes over the past few month.  What I‚Äôve ordered :  Butter Chicken : 5/5 Mutton Nihari : 4/5 Chicken Tikka : 5/5 Spicy Lemon Fish : 5/5 Chicken Hot Pepper : 5/5 Garlic Naan : 5/5  Overall 5/5. One time the breads that came were a little burnt but i feel that‚Äôs okay cause the food has always been spot on.
Five Spices is located in Sector 7, Dwarka. I like this place because of their food quality and the taste is also excellent. The packing is also good. I ordered Chilli Chicken which was very delicious.
Five spieces located in sector 7 is one of the finest delivery kitchen. They serve mughlai , chinese , and momos. I orderd panner rolls and butter chicken with kulchas. Adding to that we orderd hakka noodles which tasted well overall loved it

Radisson Blu is a great hotel, the ambiance is very nice and smoothing, I like the food also, I had their many things like grilled fish with butter sauce, gulab jamun, full course meal - tandoori roti, masala chaap, palak paneer, pudina matar curry, rajmah salad, so I really loved there food and service  Staff were soo comfortable and polite, they served us so nicely.  Overall I enjoyed alot having everything out there in Radisson Blu.

We got a very good deal from nearby so thought of giving it a try, and I do not regret the decision To start with the starters , they were cold and dry but when asked to change it , we got it hot and yum , though non veg starters were way better than the veg one . Main course was equally good but here veg takes the lead . Though we could not finish our main course because our server forget to serve us breads despite reminding twice. We had to leave our main course and jump to the deserts which was indeed the highlight of the day. Overall good experience with yummy food but not so good services
This was our first visit to this restaurant.You guys made this wonderful and memorable.Thanks a lot mr.kapil and all .Thanks for you great hospitality and special care.we will meet soon.üëçüëç
Had one of the worst food delivery experiences ever. They sent us vegetarian pasta which had chicken chunks in it. The other food items we had ordered were also bland and tasted bad. Never ordering from here, ever.
""
This is our second visit to this restaurant and we were not disappointed. We had Indian Main courses and Chinese Starters and they were all fantastic. Just the right size portions! The server was helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere within the restaurant was pleasant and relaxing. This is one of the best restaurants in Dwarka in recent times I have been to and it is well worth a visit when one is in West Delhi.
I was in Dwarka¬† with my friend and we were looking for somewhere to eat, obviously I was hankering for something spicy. When roaming the streets of Dwarka we stumbled across Skyroute, great reviews on Zomato so went for it.  It was very busy and they thankfully managed to fit us in. There was plaques up saying it was one of best Indian cuisine in Dwarka and the food lived up to it's billing.  We had Lamb dish and Chicken dish, 2 dishes I would highly recommend.  Will definitely come again!
Went here randomly on a Saturday evening after finding a table last minute on Booking Site. Had one of the best curries I‚Äôve ever had (I‚Äôve had quite a few!!). We only live around the corner but had never tried it....wish we had been here sooner as this is now going to be one of our local favourites. Staff are super friendly and food was delicious. Naan bread was out of this word. Honestly would suggest you give it a go!  Dance floor is rocking, drinks were fabulous and music is too great. they have smoking zone and¬† lounge space too
Very very bad they took full money & gave me half order. I placed order for grilled fish & did not rcvd sautee vegeies. will not order from here ever. Infact yestrdy i ordered from sehat cafe & they dilevered better tasting fish & complete order. Bad service half order cheated me..
This place is nothing but amazing ! Amazing customer service always greeted by the friendly faces of the workers. The salads and Grilled Chicken are a must have ! I Would 10/10 recommend the Grilled Chicken Breast in Concasse Sauce. Can't wait to come back!
I have placed an order over the phone and ordered chicken tikka burger and sandwiches. both were came in time.¬† Food packaging was superb and can be considered to order again. Prices are really nice for this quality. Portion was high. I def recommend this place.
Delicious food and sooo fresh . Love the friendly environment for delivery across the Dwarka, and super clean concept of Healthy meal with nutritious counts.. Love the fact that they have many options and that you could make your own salad ,with many many healthy options.
I had ordered in food last weekend from the this outlet and can‚Äôt wait to go back. Wish it was near my house. I had ordered peri peri crispy chicken burger with Rasphberry Shakes. The flavours were just amazing. Healthy food done right üòò Highly recommend place in the Dwarka!! Yay!
Dominos is all famous for its different variety of pizzas . And they have great taste in their pizzas and having pizza here will never disappoint you. Coming to my order I had golden corn pizza and onion pizza which tasted so much yummy and delicious. In dessert I tried their mc flurry which tasted superb in this cold weather. Loved the outlet.!!
""
‚ÄúStuffed ‚Äúgarlic bread??!!!Was it even stuffed with anything except corn and an tiny bit  of cheese...Terrible! Pizza look hastily made as if everything was just put together and baked just for heck of it!!!terrible experience
Ek dm bekar restaurant. Paise lete h pr order nahi dete. Sabse ghatiyaa restaurant.
I ordered 2 pizzas, one of them was a double cheese magharita. It was overcooked and completely dark with a proper lack of cheese. It didn‚Äôt even look like a single cheese magharita. I paid over 500 bucks for crap food, which I couldn‚Äôt have replaced without waiting further for 1 replaced pizza and eating my dinner with my family in fits and starts. It was basically like getting robbed with subtlety.
Food was very bed taste and uncooked and Quility was very poor plz don't place any orders in this restaurant I suggest to you kindly improve you Quility

The quality of the food is little bit compromised these days... I have been going to this place for approximately 5 years.. In his starting days the quality was awesome.
The Punjabi kukkad is worth every penny It's damn sizzling nd tasted smoky nd too good

Ordered noodles from this outlet. Noodles were over cooked well. Garnishing and aroma was also good. But tasted little bit tangy due to Vinegar... But it was OK
I ordered mutton kimma kalegi from bunny and bites but they did mixing and delivered chiken kimma and mutton kalegi.

I have tried Hakka noddles I am really impressed wow food they delivered today. Quantity and quality both amazing. I will convey to my friends as well .yummy From-Lalit
It was my first time trying this place so I was quite apprehensive. But the food was quite amazing. Although the chilli potatoes were a bit hard to chew, the fried rice and noodles were amazing with sufficient amount of flavours and spices. The delivery was also on time and the prices were also within the reasonable range.
The worst ever I ordered chilly chicken Chicken was so hard to chew  Never going to order from zomato Ever Please friends do not believe these people  They do not deliver what they pretend to
Honey Chilli Potato was good but french fries were trebbile in taste , not properly cooked . Make sure to make it good bcoz customers deserve a good one.
I ordered tawa paneer masala 2 plates and got tawa chap. I was not at home when food was delivered.My brother took the pic of wrong order but it was invalidated by zomato. Very dissapointed with this kind of behaviour from zomato.

Ordered 8 packs of paneer and paneer was missing in all the packs. Hardly one or two pieces in each pack of 160 RS. Quantity is really poor and seems they don't even care for quality
Zomato showing time is left for closing and now this restaurant is not accepting our order...we already pay for it....they are so bullshit people and delhi darbar is not cooperative
Delivery man is very professional
Worst food u get in najafgarh. Orderd 3 items all were tasteless and shit.used gobhi insted of broclli and pizza toppings were fried tomatoes and onions that are used to make curry in vegetables
Had visited this place and tried many items here such as kebabs, Platter, Cheese Maggie, pizza, pasta, noodles, manchurian, garlic noodles and in maincourse we had Dal Makhani, Paneer Takatak, lachha parantha, butter naan etc. Food was good in taste and also it is located on rooftop. Music too was playing good. But this outlet opens after 4pm not before that.
It is a bit difficult to discover this place, but google can help you. Availability of valet parking is a great help.  Situated on terrace floor , i loved their ambiance- open seating space, pool side setup, live bar and DJ. A great place for party. There are also cabana seating available here.  We ordered chicken malai tikka which was just wonderful , tasted really good. Drums of heaven is a must must try here. Really well cooked. Recommeded dish ! Farmhouse pizza was a nice try, but i didnt enjoy the flavours to an extent merely due to poorly baked crust.  Overall the food was good and ambience is worth visiting this place. Staff was courteous enough as well.
Markaz is a recently opened lounge in moti nagar , on Rama road. The locations is little odd as it is quite inside however the place and its interior makes up for it. Located on the terrace of the building it houses a actual swimming pool , with a bar and outdoor and indoor seating facility. In the food we tried their pizza , drums of heaven and chicken malai tikka and oreo shake. Each item had the perfect north indian flavors and while we were here , there was another birthday party going on and we liked the overall arrangement manage by the restaurant.

My evening to this place was superb! Staff is really nice and loved the ambiance a lot! Impressive to sit at a pool side and have your dinner!  You should try: Chicken malai tikka Veg and non-veg platter Dahi ke kebab Non- veg Pizza is delicious!  You should also try thier mains: Dal makhani Butter chicken Shahi Panner Garlic naan  Desserts are really delicious!
I home delivered some of their organic and delicious dishes. Packaging - The food was packaged in microwaveable containers and biodegradable spoons and fork was an add on. Highly appreciate their Concept of Biodegradable spoons and fork.  I ordered the Red Pasta and Red Thai Curry.  The proportion was enough for one. The Red Pasta was really delicious and non greasy. Lot of herbs added the flavours. I highly recommend this place.
Delicious taste of sandwich which has amazing stuffing with amazing quality üòã Also their packing was awesome, Perfect Quality with Enough Quantity for a person.. Their Sauces are yummy, also love the way they serve, Coz Their packaging was very nice and looks cool.. Would lobe to suggest you their BBQ Chicken Sandwich thats actually yummy...üòã
O rdered a pepperoni ham sandwich, which was not available. Was recommended the mushroom feta cheese sandwich and what I got was a poor tasting mayo filled sandwich which didn‚Äôt look anything at all like pictures. Followed up with the staff and zomato for the entire day who chose to keep 300 bucks than offer a refund and good customer service. What I got looked nothing like the original sandwich. Zomato and the restaurant kept passing the buck. Never again. Disappointing food, service and extremely impolite staff.
I was around for a meeting and ordered twigly's signature grilled chicken with ranch and pita bread and chicken fajitas with salsa n pita. Both of these were so good esp the signature grilled chicken, succulent and full of flavours. The hummus and salsa served along were both fantastic. I'm surely gonna order again.
It was one of the best pastas I've had in a long long time. The mix sauce was a perfect blend. Loved it so much. Totally recommended.
Had really pleasant time at this beautiful cafe. Just loved the ambience of this place, quite photogenic. Now coming to the food , it was also quite delcious. would definitly recomming green veg momos and pomegranate mocktail. They also have table tennis and fussball table for your entertainment and a beautiful rooftop seating as well
You can go out with your friends and have dinner lunch breakfast it‚Äôs quite enough for parties birthday parties wedding anniversary is much like family partyYou can enjoy a date with your girlfriend food is very cheap and best quality
Beautiful ambience - proper backyard , rooftop , outdoor & indoor area  Amazing food  Has playing area as well  What else you need  üòª
A very relaxing place, for long lunches or to unwind with friends. The ambience and structure is such that that seating is divided into plenty of sections. This ensures more privacy for each table.  We ordered Sangria and the bartender just nailed it. For food, we ordered Seekh Galauti, Tandoori Samosas and Mushroom Dimsums. Loved the Dimsums. Tandoori Samosas were innovative with rich cheese filling. Seekh Galauti reminded us of good old Seekh Kebabs.  Jalandhari Gobhi had fresh cauliflower minced and tempered like bhurji which tasted awesome. Laccha Paranthas are a recommended try in themselves. Crisp, not very thick and done just right.  Highlight of our lunch was Manchow Soup which like awesome. Good old authentic Manchow Soup not made this right by everyone nowadays. And Churros. Amongst the best Churros in town with such a nice chocolate sauce.

I love this place. The beers are excellent so as the food. the bartenders are all awesome. Very friendly and just a great place to relax. For sure i will be back
I liked the ambience of this place and its always full on weekends. If you want to have a good time then this is the place to spend after office. Great place to chill and have a fresh beer. Would definitely recommend this place for the great drinks & food. The staff was courteous, knew their beers well & gave good recommendations.#FreshBeer
If you love music with your fresh beer and food this place is definitely for you.Great ambience and good food with fresh beer makes up your day.
Nice place in Udyog Vihar for fresh beer options. Platter options are very good both in Veg and Non veg. Ambience is interesting and can be good fun on a typical Friday night. Visibility can improve,since many people are still not aware of this place, otherwise a good overall option.
Very un professional and rude staff... At the time of entry they promise that they would be providing happy hours where 1+1 on drinks and 25% discount on food , but at the time of billing they would say that only one offer at a time.They had hired bouncer who would start abusing if you guys ask them how.
The taste and the packaging is good one. I love the kind of food they prepare and even they pack.  Packaging a one. One plastic usage at all and that the best part I loved about them.
Aah one of the best places I have tasted.  I have taken many deliveries but this place won my heart.  The quantity was so nice  I am definitely gonna order soon.
The gravy was perfectly cooked and I'm guessing they prepare everything fresh as the food tasted amazing. Quantity and price compliment each other. Great food, tried their *Indian cuisine* and few more items seeing their reviews.
I love to try restaurant food and when I was surfing zomato my sister pointed it out and we ordered from here. It was just amazing to be try their food was just mindbowling. I loved it completely
Today I ordered from this amazing outlet called oriental mom.  Rating as per my taste.  Delivery was on time Food qantity And quality was excellent Food Taste was excellent
Really good place to eat, if you wish to eat chinese

I visited this place with my colleagues. We ordered Chilli Garlic Vegetable Dumplings, Spring rolls, Honey chilli potatoes, Chilli paneer, Hong kong night market nachos, Crispy veggies, Chow mein, machurian and created 2 bowl - one with noodles with manchurian and other with fried rice with assorted exotic vegetables.We loved the food, but the best part was starters like spring rolls, honey¬†chilli potato, crispy veggies.Make your own bowl is true value for money. Noodles were far better than chow mein.You can visit the place if you like Chinese food but this place is a bit occupied during lunch hours, so plan your visit accordingly. Service is quite slow.P.S.-I wanted to give 3.6 rating, but I am not getting how to write decimals, I was getting either 3 or 4, so I gave it 3.
A bit on the expensive side but loved the food here. Mostly I tried their ‚Äòmake your own bowl‚Äô which proved to me value for money. They have some good items as starters on ala-carte too
Such exceptional service and delicious food!¬†  I came after a tiring monday and craving for Chinese food and thoroughly enjoyed everything.¬†  Amazing delicious food! Food has a perfect blend of spices which you ought to relish!!

I recently visited this place to try out baarish ke pakore and the shahi chai. The pakore was good, however a bit over priced. The dry fruit in Shahi chai made it more tasty.
First I thought aise hi Kuch Hoga. But when I entered... Very cute and nice ambience with very nice staffs. Cake shake is must a try there. Kulcha, Mac n cheese, chat everything was very very nice. It was a nice experience there.
Love the S/W and desi chai combo. Both poha and S/W are yummy. Staff is friendly and welcoming. You can buy tea packs from here to make the same kind of tea at home.
While going back home i ordered chilli chicken for some snacks ‚ù§  It was delivered before time and that too hot and fresh ‚ù§üî• Chicken was soft and big chunks were really juicy but little bit spicy ‚ù§ It was full of veggies and tangy sauce ‚ù§  A must recommended place üëç
My friend suggested me this place named live wok ‚ù§  I ordered a chicken ramen noodles soup for dinner it was quite spicy but an awesome combination of ramen noodles and juicy chicken chunks ‚ù§ Soup was well filled with veggies and chicken ‚ù§  Packing was also really good A must try outlet üëç
While i was at my friends place we had an eager craving for some authentic chinese or asian food ‚ù§Ô∏è  And I suggested this place live wok as i had experienced their awesome food on my own ‚ù§Ô∏èüî• We ordered chicken fried rice the rice was awesome and freshly cooked also the chicken chunks were little bit chewy but fresh ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•  The packing was great and upto my expectations ‚ù§Ô∏è Will recommend this place to everyone üëç
Pad Thai chicken and Manchurian dry I tried they really have nice presentation the quantity was sufficient for me and my friend the taste is also nice and the texture was fine you should try them too! Will come back to this place to try some other amazing food.
Chicken satay was very nice I had had veg manchow soup with crunchy veg cigar rolls it had amazing presentation the taste was also very good and the hygiene is much appreciated but my favourite is chicken satay which I had as I am a chicken lover.
Well. I have been to this place many times. But now I don't have enough reason to go. The service is going down day by day and management is not in catering the order.. It is at par with any other ahata in the terms of service.. The only good reason is food taste.. Management expects us to wait and expect not quick service since it is Friday.. the wait could be as long as 30-40 minutes even for bottle of soft drink. Starters have already been served and severing plates comes after 10-15 mins. They refuse to serve onion as complimentary salad as it 70 Rs kg(obviously we will nit having 100 GM) . But expects us to 125 Rs as service charge.. Regarding service charge, it is very clearly defined that it is as per customer wish.. But u might need to deliver 5 min factual speech to prove it.. All is not so bad. I like the main course here. But u need to decide whether this service and management is worth of 600rs /per person (excluding alcohol)
"These people impose service tax forcefully and when customer ask them to remove the service charges then their waiter said ..""humne to bhar and apne menu me likh rkha h ki service charges hum lenge hi lenge....govt. Ka hume pata ni"" i think they think they are bigger than law and govt of india... And service at hyde is so poor... Orders takes too long, could be an hour or more to be delivered and even such pathetic and slow service they force customer to pay service charges..... Their buisness is simply flurishing only because it is situated right beside IT firms and the employees dnt have some better option and they are taking advantage...."
One of my favorite place to hang out with delicious food and best ambience If I talk about service it's bit slow but it's easily get managed once who have a delicious food infront of you. üòä

Do not go this place.. I went to this place on 10th Sept. with my friend and we sat in a bay where there were no sign or no specific instructions. waiter said that this place is not for stags and we need to move to other place. Upona calling Manager (Harry) which he treated is rudely that he will not serve food if we moved to other place. overall rude behaviour and bad experience. do not come here else go anywhere else

First time in radisson udhog vihar its a great experience to be here..specially food in cafe nh8 and the service staff very polite and attentive.indian food is delicious..nice .experience..
Very nice food . Specialty in butter naan as well as shahi paneer is the best dish they serve . Food is overall great in taste and they make it very fast
Amazing Cooked Food With Affordable Rate A Must For Those Late Night Cravings The Staff Is Very Polite And Also Take Instructions For Preparing The Food In Your Customised Way . Personal Recommendation- Non Veg Fried Rice And Special Non Veg Thali And Also Give A Try To Non Veg Noodles
I had giving a zero star in this restaurant all reviews are paid and service was totally bad and staff was uneducated.... Money was totally wasted..
Have ordered for around five times. The only issue is consistency. Sometimes the food is really good and the same dish on some other day is really bad. No idea why?!  Overall it's good but they need to work on consistency. Can't take risk while ordering for guests.
The best thing I love about Blue place is the number of varieties they serve. Its pretty difficult to settle on something. Best part, they make late night delivery and that too very quick! The taste is amazing..packaging is nice..delivery is quick..what else u need at 1 AM? ü§≠
Made in online order.waitet for over an hour an a half just to be informed that the order has been processed.pathetic costume services

Place is fake. Says happy Hakka on Zomato though the food they send is from a local Chinese place, quite apparent in the packaging and the taste. The happy Hakka I have been to and ordered from sent meals in excellent packing, with cutlery and with their menu. This one is fake. Sponsored by Zomato most probably. They have taken down my previous review of this restaurant... please beware. I had to literally chat with Zomato rep for an hour to get my refund for the fake order from this bogus place. It's a shame that Zomato has not looked into this yet and is continuing this disservice to the customer. Also Zomato - putting honest reviews should not be a violation of your policies. #fake
Delicious Chinese food. The food is very flavourful and spicy although the delivery of hot food is done in plastic boxes that are toxic and may prove to be harmful in the future. Other than that, the food is great. Big thumbs up :)
Ordered veg noodles and they were delicious. The quantity is well suited for 1-2 persons! The price set for the same is fine too. All in all, a Good experience!
""
This is my all time favorite. The best part is that they bake their own dough. Amazing variety of pizza. Recently I tried Indi Paneer Tandoori pizza with cheese burst. It was loaded with and veggies and paneer. Loved it. And also the farmhouse is spice lovers delight do give a try. Follow me Priti Tahiliani
""
"Always prefer takeaway for some quick bites, this time I have tried their all new vegetarian variants in heading ""world pizza league"". They have introduced variants, we have tried 4 variants, one left which was English cheddar and veggies. Personally I liked out of 4 is, Indi Tandoori Paneer pizza, it was superb and amazing in taste, find all spicy ingredients for the first time which were missing in domino's pizza. 2nd one was Jamaican Jerk Veg, which was also very good in taste. 3rd one is American Peri Peri Veg pizza, was slightly disappointed me, because we loved Peri Peri chilly variants. 4th one is Aussie Barbecue Veg, which was tangy in taste and not upto the mark. Overall nice experience with best quality pizza outlet."
we ordered food from you, but due to your problem our order got rejected and money is debited from account. Now your web-site is saying that money is refunded but it is not credited in my account.l
Great place.  The staff members here are really nice.  The quality of the pizza is also good.  It is very near to Mangla puri and is a great place for a quick pizza.  They also deliver the pizza at your doorsteps.  There is also live music that is played.  And the average wait time here is approx 10 minutes.  I had a good experience.

My order no 512 was ordered at 1919. It's now 2045 still the tracking shows order being prepared. There goes the USP of Domino's about delivery in 30min. The person attending calls says the delay is due to rush at the outlet. In that case they shouldn't accept delivery orders. Pathetic state of affairs. The person on phone is also not sure when will it be delivered.
Best place to fulfill your pizza cravings. I personally like farmhouse. Rest depends on person to person. The ambience is average and the staff is friendly.
I ordered full but delivered half
I ordered thali but everytime some item missed in thali Plz guys check order before pick up . I pay for complete thali why some item miss. Kindly Zomato care see the issue
Good facility and good food Nice restaurant all over this is the best one restaurant üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç Fast delivery no extra payment And all rate are not expensive üò¨ üòÅüòÅüòÅ
This place is like heaven for veg lovers specially who want to have pure veg food late night..food quality is upto the mark with very fast delivery timing.
Food, service, everything was great. The only things that weren't quite okay were the lack of plates, insufficient curd, pickle and chutney with the 3 plates of paranthas that were ordered.

Very good in taste and reasonable price....

Snacks and main course good. But, I recommend snacks. Pocket friendly place apt for students. Complimentary sheesha was given to the customers exceeding order of ‚Çπ500.
The place is totally for the hookah lovers. The food is just above the average, nothing special. The staff is friendly . The ambience is okayish. All in all , an okay place , just don't expect much.
All the cuisines was so yummy and lip smacking. Chaap tandoori paneer and rotis was delicious.. The services was so fast and good and ambience is also Fab..... Dal makhni was at its best... I hadn't tried non veg but it was also luking tempting and scrumptious .. Go today and satisfy ur sinful cravings The White Pepper Whitepepper #foodblog #dailyfeed #food #india #newdelhi #satya
So college buddies the place is for you. Place is about 150m from Satyaniketan Metro station . Having a medium budget it serves you good food and sheesha We had white sauce pasta(rich creaminess) , veg noodles(served hotüî•), Corn jalapeno pizza üçï(Ignore adding chilli üå∂Ô∏è) , Chilli Potato (Mandatory) , Dahi Kebab (stuffed nicely) and Cheese Nachos (less of chesse) AMBIANCE : 3/5 TASTE : 3.5 /5 QUALITY :4/5 QUANTITY : 3.5 /5 SHEESHA : 4.5 /5 VALUE FOR MONEY : 3.5/5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
This place is have a good ambience and the sitting arrangements , lighting inside is perfect if you are in a mood for a party and their combos are perfect if you have low budget The only thing I don't like here is Thier pizza's and food.

Super yummy taste would love to order again n again.
At the time of Navratri, you gotta get something really good! This is the first time I ordered from here and I fell in love with it! Amazing food, quality was nice and so was quantity as whole! Thank you!!!!!
There Thali is amazing and there Kofta and mixed veg is to die for. Love love love. Also I like the way they pack the whole thing and deliver to the house.
Food quality & quantity is good. I have ordered food many times. Loving it.... specially I like kadai paneer and veg biryani.. I would to visit restaurant...
Veg Manchurian combo: Half Gravy Manchurian (4 balls), 2 veg momos, half fried rice.  Manchurian had thick gravy and also tasted good. I don't like Momos though but these ones I enjoyed a lot. Fried rice contained lot of veggies.  Taste: 5/5 Quantity: 4.5/5 Packaging: 5/5
Good place, but very much crowded , not able to click pictures as over crowded, Food is good but quantity is very less according to price.

After a 1 hour long wait on Sunday evening, me, my mom and my grandma got a table at Diggin. We started with the Chicken Minestrone Soup that came with Bread, Breadsticks and Butter. The soup was heart warming and soul warming. For Main Course, we each ordered a dish: ~ Seafood Risotto that consisted of Squid, Prawn and Fish. My grandma wanted something in rice so we went in for this beautiful tasting Italian Rice. This dish is highly recommended to seafood lovers. ~ Fish and Chips: Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, yummy sole fish served with Fries, Tartare Dip and Salad. This dish is highly recommended to fish lovers. The combination is perfect. ~ Lamb Bolognese Lasagne: Perfect is the word for this dish. A must have! Just the right amount of cheese, pasta and minced lamb in bolognese sauce. For drinks, my elders had Jasmine Tea and Black Tea while I had Ferrero Rocher Shaake. I enjoyed my drink while they enjoyed theirs. For desserts, we shared a scoop of vanilla ice cream and Tiramisu. The Tiramisu was so yummy! Our total bill was around 2700/- which is quite economical for 10 items. The ambience is cute and comfy. The crowd is mostly young and family. The service is quick and the servers are polite. Loved it here! Will come back for more soon!
The assistant manager named Sina was extremely rude, impolite and ill-mannered.
A place that i visited by mistake and since then im visiitng this place on purpose again n again due to its amazing food  I personally loved the ambience over there and value for money food  I love German chocolate shake accompanied by their Beyonce burger and chipotle style pizza. IN LOVE WITH FOOD HERE
An awesome place with such good ambience, you will love it. Located in Satya niketan. The place is just beside the DD metro station on pink line. The place has 2 floors. Prefer the first floor, as it has personal areas. Coming to the food I tried pizza, fries ,shakes and burger.Everything that I order was so delicious.The cheesy Fries had an amazing dip to compliment them. I must mention one thing that although the food was finger licking good but the quantity was not so satisfactory. This is a perfect place for a get together for friends or family with ample space for large groups.
The banana Nutella crepe is the best here, i can come again n again n again for the food... Ambience is pleasant, overall It is awesome!!!!!
Must visitüòã

I have been to this restaurant with my family and then friends.  A place that will never disappoint in terms of  -> Fantastic service -> Great Food -> A huge menu to choose from -> Diverse choices in terms of fish, chicken and veg dishes  There is a diverse menu to choose from coastal food to chicken dishes and their new wine collection. The chef is a Manglorian and cooks great meals with help of rest of the team.  Do look at some great food pictures which totally do not do any justice to the food taste, authentic, earthy and great place to enjoy a fun meal with family, friends and office folks.  They have a huge parking so that shouldn't be a problem. We travelled all the way from Gurgaon to Delhi for lip smacking food and taste
Yesterday i went to attend friend get together and sanadige was on my must visit list from a long period of time, that was the one reason we selected this location. The restaurant is located in very beautiful area of Chanakya Puri full of greens all around the manager himself their at the entry to welcome us so kind of him, and provided us a very good table so that 7-8 people can sit comfortably.  As it is a south Indian restaurant that serve some very authentic and delicious mangalorian food, we tried many of their famous dishes such as ghee roast jumbo prawns Mutton sukka Kaju sanadige Alambe sukka Kokum flavoured chicken Pamfret masala fry And the best of all the starters was prawn salad.  For mains we had Vegetable stew Chicken kundapuri Mangalore mutton curry  And breads we had Kerala Appam  Appam Need Dosa Sanna Pundi Kerala Paratha  Dessert we had their very famous elaneer payasam i highly recommend everyone must not leave without trying it. Overall we had a very great experience here in every aspect be it service, food, ambience, or anything everything was perfect. A must visit place for someone who really wants to explore some authentic south indian food.
This is the place I take my special guests - business or family.

Does true-blue coastal cuisine in the heart of Delhi seem too good to be true? Not if you consider that Goldfinch's brainchild¬† Sanadige has come straight from Bangalore to present Delhiites with the choicest delicacies of the coastal belt.¬† ¬† Located at the commercial centre in Chanakyapuri and occupying three floors, all accessible by means of a one-of-its-kind hydraulic lift, Sanadige glorifies expeditions of adventurers, and fresh catch of fisherfolk by means of wall murals and figurines.¬† ¬† Tables are laid out in the classic manner with even the table napkins shaped in the form of boats, while there are intricate wooden carvings and comfortable seating arrangements.¬† ¬† Crisp Appalams are served in a medieval wagon, accompanied by six dips, to snack on, while one awaits the deliciousness that arrives at your table from Chef Sukesh's kitchen. ¬† ¬† Meals are served on a fresh banana leaf, as is the custom in southern states. Each day's fresh catch is sourced directly from Mangalore. ¬† ¬† Here's what would form for a delectable meal when visiting Sanadige...¬† ¬† Among the appetizers, though we started off on a crunchy and crispy note with Kalimirchi Lotus Stem and in-house specialty Kaju Sanadige, Kori Ghee Roast which has chicken pan tossed with masala made of Byadgi chilli, Ghee, & Manglorean spices and Butter Pepper Garlic Prawns are two of my favourites when dining at Sanadige. ¬† ¬† To go along with the meal, there was what I like to call the Panchratna beverages from the menu because it's difficult to choose a favourite - Kerala's spicy butter milk tempered with¬† fresh coriander, ginger, turmeric, curry leaves - Sambharam - Sweet and spicy blend of black pepper, jaggery, tamarind and water - Yedde Punchi Panaka - concoction of kokum and sweetened water - Punar Puli - Chilled coconut milk & dried kokum, spices¬† and tempered with roasted garlic - Sol Kadi - Fresh tender coconut water flavoured with pressed ginger and lime - Elaneeru Shunti Nimbehannu¬† ¬† Moving forward with the Main Course, we had the choicest of coastal delicacies at our disposal, replicating a home-made meal from down South. ¬† ¬† While Kori Kundapuri is one of Sanadige's signature chicken curries, the Malabar Vegetable Stew rendered in rich coconut milk is a winner, and I had also tried shellfish - Marvai Sukka that's best when tried at Sanadige for the authentic preparation. ¬† ¬† Sanadige's staple Bread Basket consisting of Appams, Neer Dosa, Malabar Parantha, and Pundi were the perfect pairing with each of these curries. ¬† ¬† Apart from this, the Nei Choru or rice tossed with cashew nuts, onions, and curry leaves, rendering the pleasant aroma of Ghee is nicely paired with Alleppey Meen Manga - mildly bony fish curry. ¬† ¬† As for the sweet conclusion to the meal, Elaneer Payasam had the most aesthetic presentation and came in a coconut itself, which concealed in it a sweet concoction of coconut cream, pulp, and an assortment of nuts. On the other hand, Sanadige also has a number of gluten-free preparations, and among desserts, they have Finger Millet pudding that they call Ragi Mani. ¬† ¬† Chef Sukesh was even gracious enough to show us their Spice Thali with various condiments sourced from Mangalore, and Mr. Dhananjay for being attentive towards our table and serving with a smile at all times. ¬† ¬† On the whole, Sanadige is one of the handful of places that aim at presenting authentic coastal cuisine to its patrons in Delhi and do a fantastic job out of it too. :)
Recently visited ITC Maurya - Bukhara for a casual lunch with my friends. ITC Maurya has a great ambiance and definitely a treat for eyes. Talking about Bukhara, the ambiance of the restaurant might not be the best but their DAL is real delicacy and along with Indian bread its a treat. We also ordered Paneer Kurchan but it was not worth it and very ordinary.  The biggest set down was when we got to know that one of our frnd has her birthday we wanted to cut the cake but the restaurant was not able to arrange for a simple cake.
Nice seating! Dal was great so was the mutton seekh! Good quality food

Qd was a place i learned how momos are exclusively presented in such amazing flavours and taste. Tandoori momos and other chinese dishes are a love.

I had a great experience in this Qd's . Amazing food and ambience, Service is also nice. Presentation of food is really good. Over all i had a nice time. Best palce to hangout with friends.  
Such pathetic food I have never had in my life. Earlier it was the best momos, and now they are the worst momos.

Tried their picante pizza at horn ok please fest...the quantity was good and it was very cheesylicious.... just amazing
An amazing place to hangout with value for money food and instaworthy interiors.
The cafe interiors and ambiance are pretty cool. The food menu is also interesting. However, most of the things in platter were served cold even though the taste was good.
Nice rooftop cafe in satyaniketan with such an affordable prices and food is very delicious and very cheap. Hokkah is also very gud. Quality is gud Presentation is nice Ambience is nice ‚ù§Ô∏èüòã

When I arrived there, the staff said that there is no place in an open area but when they placed my table on the rooftop then there was no one sitting over there. The cafe didn't look like the way it has shown in the images.
I can never get bored of this beautiful cafe located in satyaniketan... They have such a friendly staff and ofcourse their food is fabulous too.. If I talk about their menu then again it is quite affordable. I had always preferred rooftop sitting which is far better than indoor one.. Will definitely visit off campus again.
It has a fine dine kind of an atmosphere with good services. There is a lot of greenery around the place. Talking about the food we had litti Chokha and puri Basket. Litti chokha is must to try when you are trying bihari food as it's a trademark dish of bihari food. It was served with aloo and daal. Food was balanced as all the items in the plate served different and complimented taste. Puri basket had three different kinds of puri filled with sattu along with pumpkin sabzi, boondi ka raita and some pickle with mango chutney. Overall, it was my first ever experience of bihari food and I really liked it. It billed around ‚Çπ600/- üÖ≥üÖ∏üÖΩüÖ∏üÖΩüÖ∂ üÜÜüÖ∏üÜÉüÖ∑ üÜÅüÖ∏üÖ∞
Hello everyone, The best i like the most is the location and it have a beautiful garden view as well that so with outside sitting arrangements.. must try dishes are biryani and tikki..
This is a beautiful place with such beautiful delicacies from the state of Bihar. As much as I was tempted to try everything on the menu, we could only have select dishes and all of them were simply delightful. The taste is so refined, so simple and yet immersed in rich flavours. I believe this is must visit for folks who are on Dilli Darshan. The place has a beautiful view of an open garden with monkeys wandering around who are just peacefully engaged in, well I guess, monkey chores and are not a bother at all. Delhi has indeed the perks of being a capital with such diverse celebration of food and culture. Cannot help but hope to have Potbelly in Bangalore too!!
Honestly this was my first time trying out authentic Bihari food! I usually eat meat when I go out but at Potbelly I ate their delicious ‚ÄúShakahaari‚Äù food complete with Litti Choka, Dal, multi color puris and mirch paratha.  Their meal is delicious and more than filling!
Being a Connoisseur I love trying out different cuisines. I have tried out quite a few cuisines across various regions in India but had never really tried out Bihari Cuisine. I had never come across any restaurants that were dedicated to Bihari food, so when I found out about The Potbelly I decided to give it a shot. The Potbelly is located at Chanakyapuri inside the Bihar Niwas so you will basically have to go inside the Bihar Niwas. Since there is no board outside it sometimes gets difficult to find the place.

Went for breakfast and ordered the chicken bagle with bacon bits. Delicious sandwich. Licked the crumbs off the plate. Service can be a little better. But as long as they‚Äôre serving good food, I can overlook a few things!
Firstly they didn‚Äôt bother to serve water ! Services were not so good ! Iff i talk about food yea its good in taste and different from many !
A very homely, warm and intimate bistro. Located in a very quiet area of Delhi gives this place wonderful surroundings; all green, yellow and blues. Happy and helpful staff who don't mind to custom make your dish and helps with quick service. We ordered Grilled halloumi sandwich : 4/5 Pesto spaghetti : 3/5 (Undercooked Pasta) And coffees, which were great! Had a good experience! Also, advisable to make prior reservation.
""
It‚Äôs been a good experience to be there at pirates of grill, Non veg food is quite amazing . If you are binge foodie must visit this place
A very nice place with a great ambience and great service. The buffet they have and the variety of dishes they have are amazing. The food is also very tasty and very delicious.
it serves a variety of dishes in its buffet but i liked its crispy corns its a best place to give your hungry friends a good treat #buffet#food
""
Whatever I expect, it serves me more than that along with the taste which I always find in the cuisine. This time moment had a blossom from the community of fruit which was Mango. Few dishes had been added with the core values for mango pulp and essence which I loved it. Again pineapple won my heart and paneer tikka,crispy corn, halwa,mango cake, palak corn, chhole, arbi, methi aloo and other dishes in the plate.. Always recommend to have tatse.
""
This place is same as any other place in Rajouri, in a good way. Cute, small with a vibrant outdoor and indoor seating arrangement. The ambiance is nice, very party like and the crowd seems fine. The food is nice and this place offers a vast menu to choose from. The overall experience is fine.
""
It has degraded since last year
Its like Been that, Done that, nothing so special about the place. Also yet when Menu items aren't available and you literally are left out for 5 mins just trying to call a server, this wont make you quite fond of the place.  Ambiance-¬† The outdoor seating feels a little incomplete being some of the tables short in height, and little uncomfortable. Didn't explore Indoor seating, being to dark for our afternoon visit inside. Otherwise The place is well organised and adequately placed seating I must say.¬†  Service- The people who serve are quite humble and understanding, But it feels like they are half lost and other half need to confirm most of the details after order. - Ordered Thick shake, and after 15 mins when the order should be ready and served, we were informed it isn't available. - As we entered , settled, requested for menu and water, and even after the menu was provided to us it took another request for just a glass of water.  Food- -We really enjoyed the Charred Mushroom Pizza, perfectly baked , thin crust and adequately cheesey for the meal -Also We ordered Veg Spaghetti White Pasta which was made quite right, but the vegetables in it felt a little raw and wasn't palatable due to the same. -Masala Narangi, its quite an innovative drink and with tangy twist taste in it.  Also yes, being fond of Parmesan cheese with pasta, and as requested for it, the chef served us Mozzarella, Just saying a chef should be aware of the difference.
One word Awesome...paneer threesome and dahi kebab at its best. Must visit place. Cool ambience and really cooperative staff.

its a must go to place for Indian fusion food.

We ordered teachers highland cream and intead got served sm very cheap alcohol. When we called the manager, he had the audacity to defend his wrong doing. I had already paid fr the drinks through nearby app, either wud have not paid them a penny. Plus the behavior of the waiting staff wasnt too pleasing.
""
I went here on Christmas. the ambience is good but the food is average we tried their pizza which was not good and pasta which was just average .So they need to improve in their food quality
Visited with friends for a Meetup. The place is nice and very affordable I must say . We ordered vegetarian dishes and everything was under 250 rs which is very less as compared to other restaurants. The taste of food is good . We liked chilly paneer, palak patta chaat and veg dim sums . Nice place to go for a pocket friendly meal .
It was an great fun to be at Duty Free. Mr Parkash was really very helpful in making my Mom‚Äôs b‚Äôday celebration a memorable one. The food is also great, staff is friendly also very friendly and courteous, the manager himself came to have a look if everything is going well. 5/5 stars. I and my family had a great time at Duty Free, Rajouri Garden.

I ordered their nonveg special thali and it was great. Butter chicken-10/10 Butter Naan-10/10 Dal makhni -10/10 Chicken tikka-10/10 Jeera Rice-10/10 Gulab Jamun-10/10 Everything was great and i loved it completely. I would highly recommend their Nonveg thali.
Ordered daal makhni with mirchi paratha.. Rating details - Taste - Average. Food color and texture- Good. Packaging- Excellent. Presentation- Good..  But key factor taste was just average which was bit disappointed.
Out of the numerous cafes on the straight road in rajouri, Mealodrama was the one which caught our eye. They do offer parking service even tough we didnot opt for the same. Coming back to the cafe Ambience - 3/5 Food - 4/5 Rate -4/5 They have two kind of seating arrangements, one was semiclosed which we opted for and the other is closed which doesn't have sunlight and looks like a night club kinda feel. The best thing of the place was how they presented food. The price is also within medium budget
"Among the plethora of cafes and eatries located in Rajouri garden, this one caught our attention because of its quirky name ""MEALODRAMA"". The place was decent in terms of ambiance and we were seated in a separate area as there was a party going on. From the menu we ordered: Afro chicken tikka, New York yankie fries, corn and cheese masala balls, Californian club pizza chilly paneer and few drinks including liit. The peri-peri sauce in the chicken tikka was sufficient to tingle our tastes buds ( do not order this if your are not into spicy food), the fries were topped with several sauces which as combo tasted well. The corn and cheese balls seemed welcoming but the stuffing inside was decent (didn't meet our expectations of cheese oozing out though) and taste was fine. Chilly paneer was good enough and the club pizza was one of its kind offering two different crusts ( ate it for the first time) and blend of cheese with veggies which was good to go with the drinks. Apart from the food, the staff was courteous and the place was happening, thanks to the ongoing party."
The food was really bad. The staff wasnt friendly. Very poor ambience. Limited variety to choose from
Food is bad and staff service is very poor plus they charge u evn for car parking Worst experience and lack of hygiene
Just loved their special cheese pizza,it was so goood and super yumm..a must try,what i didnt like was the qunatity of chicken was  a little less ,resr everything was on point. one should definitely visit atleast onceüòçand order double layered cheese pizza.you will love it. Watermelon mocktail was also good,i have had better though.
Very good service by Rakesh. Very friendly and available
Good service good ambience ganesh has been a great person at the restaurant
serviced by rakesh sharma .good food and drink
Rakesh
Star Kumar has been really warm with his hospitality and helped us with food options. Amazing food, amazing services
I had Zingy pineapple corn salad and Dahi ki tikki. Deliciously crispy aloo tikki served with green chutney and garnished with basil leaves is a treat to taste buds. Such an amazing concept, the staff is female only.I love presentation the most. And taste is as good as it looks.
Such a terrible experience The food was so damn bad Ambience is quite good But people visit places with good food, they don't only visit for ambience. @fromdifferentkitchens #foodporn
Nice place. Nice ambience. Good food.
We booked a table for 31st night here with unlimited drinks and snacks. Well, let me come straight to the point; its all well and good to promote feminism but the fact of the matter is this place is highly mismanaged by women, look at the irony of the situation. There was only 1 male bartender there who was also very very slow and besides there were 4-5 girls who had no idea what bartending is and how u make drinks. Bartenders are expected to be swift, but these girls took their own sweet time in making a drink. We guys had to shout our lungs out for these people to understand what we wanted. Have developed cough due to this, while I understand that there was loud music but still having to wait approx 10-15 mins to get a drink. And yes, believe it or not, this place offered unlimited drinks, so what do u expect that u will get drinks which were there in the deal, but no this place ran out of beer(light) and even coke. As absurd as it may sound. Does this place even deserve to be taken seriously. Some of the people were also agitated there due to lack of professionalism amongst the bartenders. Apparently the manager had to step in to calm down the situation, dont know whether she was the manager or owner. The washrooms there were so stinky that u wud mistake them for shulab shochalaya. Even those smell better as they take rs 2 from everyone and clean them. All the Shulab Shochalayas wud be feeling proud today that they have finally found a place which is stinkier than them. Felt pukish when I went inside the washroom. All in all I feel that my money was wasted at this place.

They should improve their service, quality of food.. as well as change the prices.... Will never visit again...üôè It takes 30 minutes to serve your order at table.... Pls don't visit... I paid 3400 RS but we were still hungry you know what because we had nothing to eat because of quality of food... And service...

Best biryani love
Better then dominos.really love peri peri pizza
Called the outlet for delivery of pizza as had heard that they serve some amazing pizza and sides. Ordered 14 inches slumdog millionnaire veg pizza with thin crust. The pizza sauce was amazing and lip smackin‚Äô. The softness of the pizza was well maintained and it was packed nicely, delivered on time. Also, tried their brownie fudge shake which was indulgence of chocolate in cold milk. Liked both the items. üëçüèª
A perfect place to get delivery from. The food tasted amazing. The delivery was super fast. The food was hot and lovely. The presentation was damn good. Pasta Pizza ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5
Anyone who says that money cannot buy happiness , then they haven't ordered from Brooklyn Pizza yet, because the food was worth the money..! The yummy Oink Oink Pizza is a must try guys, the base was soft, the pizza had pork, bacon, pork sausages toppings which made the taste so good. Also tried the spaghetti meatballs with bread, literally the taste of spaghetti meatballs was so good..!
""
As i am fan of butter chicken,so i was trying to find new places where i can get good butter chicken,came across this restaurant so ordered to try if its nice or not,and to my surprise it was sooo good, the chicken was so fresh and super creamy gravy. Had it with butter naan, fan of their butter chicken‚ù§Ô∏è
The establishment was not cooperative in to simple request like a) the chicken pieces in Butter Chicken be small and butter be supplied separately.They refused to accede to this request. I also didnot like the overall taste of the preparation.
Rara mutton, Dal makhani and fish fingers are must try
Extremely pathetic service, ordered for bone less chicken and received chicken with bones..that too when extra money is paid, disappointed, would not use Zomato any more
I had chicken jumbo . Its a great for a person. Loved itü•∞
""
This place serves really nice burgers which are definitely better than the likes of MC Donald's and burger king . Bunty pappe da aaloo tikki burger and shahi paneer burger are amazing and are big in size too .
When late night hunger strikes, this place comes to the rescue. I ordered Veg Burgers and got them delivered on time.  The sauces added in the burger to make it crispier were more than I expected them to be. The sauces were overpowering the taste of the veggies and the stuffing.  Food: 3/5. Delivery: 4/5. Packaging: 5/5
The place is on the main road so it is easily approachable....the ambience is fine ..the place is usually less crowded The burgers are as always good and delicious I had the value meal and it was good as always
""
Have tried their afghani chaap roll which is just amazing
Better is you order through app because there is no sitting space, i have been going there since ages and really love chaap snacks. Tandoori stuff paneer chaap is awesome.
""
Superb chaap and I am from Pune and hope this guys to come to Delhi again and have this chaap.being veggeterian I am amazed the variety of aoya chaap this place have.
The food was really nice. But it literally took an hour and a half to reach and was cold by that time. The hot chocolate fudge is really yummy.
If u sick to eat paneer recipes then order the food from this restaurant because the paneer recipes are very delicious and in a very good quantity also .so I personally suggest order paneer burji recipe from this restaurant and definitely u will be satisfied and the value of the money is counted ..
We ordered Kadhai Paneer with medium spice and 5 rotis. The Kadhai paneer was creamy and tasted weird. It was unappetizing. Not a good experience at all.
its great to deal with you gyuz
Order reaching after almost 2 hours. I guess that summarises the whole rating bit. The guy kept on telling me it'll be with you in a bit. All I ordered was a chicken tikka on the food front. It was delivered warm nonetheless but have never had such fibrous and dry tikka ever. The food was tasteless to be very polite at my best, and after 2 hours of delivery it was pointless nonetheless. I don't know what to say anymore, if you guys know you're gonna be late just inform so people can arrange from elsewhere or consider the option. And please improve your tikkas at least, a snack like that can't have any of the excuses of going wrong in this living world I know. I've had better tikkas on a road side stall. Frozen ones are way above the quality you deliver. Hate writing reviews like these, but had to. Game up guys, there are other places with way more potential and service attributes than you. Don't know if I'll order again.
""
If interested in good authentic north Indian food ,then this restaurant is a good choice. I visit and ordered many time. Value for money for tongue lickers
Yesterday I was ordered tawa chicken with brain, item was uncooked and very pathetic, brain pieces are very big and row, chicken gravy is like tomato puree, when I complained no one pay attention to us. Food quality is going down day by day.
I ordered chicken Biryani and believe me one of the worst Biryani I have ate upto now, super costly and too less in quantity and quality. Please never ever order it
""

I like crispy Jalebi.
Personally i love there sweets , Pav bhaji and sunday special breakfast Poori Aloo  They Prepare sweets freshly on daily basis and quality is very great   Specially I recommend You should try there Sunday special breakfast Poori Aloo it‚Äôs amazing i love it ü•∞
I tried their sweets and I must say they were very delicious.. Totally fresh and Indian Sweet lovers must try their sweets.. I love their chocolate burfi.. Expensive but worth it..

Visit this restaurant I order pizza taste was good cheese quality is not good. Good service
The dishes are awesome very delicious, This restaurant is my first priority in my city. I highly recomment this restaurant for having a mouth watering food..
Like there chicken shawarma it was too yum and good
""
Order changezi and it was like chicken curry in taste... pls change the chef..or tell him to nizzamuddin to have changezi.
The chicken Shawarma was not only unappetizing but also under cooked. Would not recommend
""
""
We ordered masala papad, murgh malai tikka üòç and daal makhani and tandoori roti.. and everything was yummy!! Though the meal proportion is quite appropriate but the pricing is bit on the higher side.
""
""
I think this place is bit hyped. I tried a momos and a chicken lollipop combo. It took 45 mins to get my order, alot of delay. There's no management for taking the order, it's like a whole crowd at the counter and you have to step in to get it. That's why most of the people get their order in cars. The food is good , Chicken lollipop - deep fried chicken with poured cream over the top, too much which I feel kind of taking over the taste of chicken. Kurkure Chicken momos - The filling was good Overall an okay experience from my side.
""
""
It was my first experience of tummy section and it did not disappoint. We had creamy paneer momos and they were yummy, I have visited that outlet 5 more times after that
This is a must try. This place serves you with super delicious kebabs, shawarma rolls, momos, chicken lollypops and drum sticks etc. I'm in love with this place. It's pocket friendly and makes you and your stomach happy as well. üî•

Everything was rocking.. Food was delicious and quantity was huge. Service was the best as Narender was soo humble and guided me through the menu. I AM COMING BACK AGAIN!!
""
I accidentally found this place. I was so hungry and was heading to order some quick food so when i found this place i thought I should try this.  Staff was little occupied so the manager Mr. Amit attended me. Very polite and humble guy. Explained me the whole concept and the menu.  I ordered Delhi Burger which was humungus and so delicious. I bet on one can eat 2 burgers.  Pasta alfredo was good but i had some issues with it so i called the chef and explained him.  All over experience was good Service was quick and satisfactory.  Nice place to calm different cuisine craving at one place...
Everything was amazing, loved the pina colada. The server Jeevan was very polite and attentive.

I ordered a wah hi wah spl thali the items which that serve was horrible. Briyani and naan was uncooked. There is no taste in the subzi overall my first experience was very bad

Good place to order from . Tikka items are good . I order paneer and chaap tikka from here regularly and they have been good
I love there tandoori chicken momosss!! üòç And the stuffing is also very juicy, that's my favourite thing.
""
The food was not freshly cooked. It was Stale(Baasi) food which was delivered to me. It had overcooked (black) vegetables in chowmin and undercooked vegetables and rice in Fried Rice. Highly Disappointed with the experience
The dishes are awesome very delicious, This restaurant is my first priority in my city. I highly recomment this restaurant for having a mouth watering food..

Over the top is not good at all. Their Manager Mr. Sumit is a big big lier. He confirmed our booking in the month of December for Lohri Function. But, In January 1st week he started lying by saying we have some licence issue and we need to shut our bar completely. Actually, he confirmed to other party by taking huge amount and he cancelled our booking. Their snacks and food is also pethetic... Never ever book with this guy as he is a big lier...
One of the worst places I have ever been too for dinner...... It's not at all value for money, uncooperative staff. Not at all recommended, you will come back with spoil mood for sure.
Food was very tasty. We tried chicken tikka, grilled salad, tikka masala, kofte and roti. We also took beer which was reasonable. An offer runs there where in at the cost of 4 pints you get 5 pints. We initially did not order this offer and took 4 pints, and when we requested for changing it then they did not oblige. There were no peanuts witb drinks. Otherwise ambience was quiet, food was tasty and service was quick
In food I love their Thai green curry  Must try!!! Mocktail :-  5/5 Food :- 5/5 Service:-5/5 Ambience:- 5/5
Must tried items drumsticks and mojito,nice ambience to spend with your love ones. Server suman was very courteous and helpful.love to came always here
it's amazing place. food and drinks were really nice and quality of food was also very nice.

"ok so i ordered a meal comprising of a ""crunchy"" veg burger, peri peri ""fries"" and a pepsi. Now what i have quoted is not to be ignored, it is like what you expect and what you get( i have attached an image explaining what i mean to say). First of all the burger was not crunchy at all since there was no onions or tomatoes or even veggies inside the burger as shown in picture( what you show is what you should deliver) only burned patty with chipotle dressing i suppose. Also by peri peri ""fries"" you meant to say peri peri ""wedges""? and even these were not peeled off potatoes, worst wedges i have ever had. I meant to say deliver what you say or show. I was wondering something else and got something else. Taste wise it wasnt good at all, soggy fries and tastless patty"

DOSAS MADE IN OIL AND CHARGED 200-300. DETORIATED TASTE. NO COMPLAINTS LISTENED. FOOLISH TO ORDER FROM HERE.
Expensive place but they provide good quality south indian food. We ordered utpam and masala dosa which was good. Good place if you want to eat and spent some peaceful time.
This restaurant is among my favs as i'm a south indian food lover. The vibes i get here are so pleasing and the ambience is so calm. The food is superb and value for money!
otherwise this is a nice place to have the authentic south indian food...this time when i called for a delivery the food was passable...the idlis were nice and the masala dosa was quite ok...expected the food to be a lot better
Stale or inhygenic food was served to is on this 5 star hotel restaurent. We had booked a pool side table by paying Rs.4900. But the service and food quality and hygeine was pathetic to say the least.  It a shame that a hotel which claims to be 5 star can have such kind of food served to its customers. The food served was cold, poor taste and very next day throat infection.  Shameful
GOT SEVERE THROAT INFECTION after having Anniversary celebration dinner. On 25th Jan, I had booked a dinner date on pool side by paying Rs.4900 at the hotel.  But, the food quality and service was hardly near to 4 or 5 star hotel. Food was served cold. The taste was pathetic. Even roadside Dhaba have good taste than this.  On the very next day in the morning, I was unable to swallow anything properly. The reason was Stale food served by this 5 star Hotel.  Its a shame that how such a hotel who claims to be 5 star can serve such kind of food to its customers.
Excellent food and service.¬† Specially Saksham hositality was great.¬† Chef Himanshu dishes were delicious and ambience was good. Pool side sitting in isolated space was nice
Great Service by Mr.Saksham. Overall quality of food was really great. Nice ambience.
The hospitality was too good. We really enjoyed and want to come again very soon.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED..Perfect and high quality masalas used..a truely shahi experience..they serve perfect biryani at reasonable price....awesome
It was not upto the mark , was delivered late so it was not hot
Queema gosht biriyani is a must try. Very nice flavour and good quantity of mutton. As for the Murg Kefta biriyani, the taste is okayish. Items are very pricey as compared to other biriyani specific restaurants. However full marks for the way they pack and send for delivery.
I loved the briyani. I have orderd briyani from this place so many times and i have always loved it. The khusboo and the swayd both are perfect and packing is also too cute üòãüòã
""
I ordered Creamy chaap roll and veg chilli momos from here. Packaging was good and the food was fresh and hot. Chaap in the roll was amazing and the roll sheet was very soft. Chilli momos is not that spicy and eatable.
This is one of the best restaurant in our locality. We ordered several time from here. We ordered here steamd momos, crunchy chicken, schezwan fried rice. Momo was too much smooth and soft. Size of momo was good enough. Chicken item eas delicious and flavourful one. Chicken was freash. Schezwan fried rice was best item frim here. Amazing aromatic and mouth watering item Food:5/5 Food presentation :5/5 Quality :5/5 Delivery :5/5 Delivery timing was great. We strongly recommend the place.
Really really good

A very nice place for BUFFET in the middle of delhi which is easily accessible. This place offers a huge variety of food when it comes to their buffet.It feels like you are attending some sort of food festival as the theme of this restaurant is totally different . A lot of food items were not up to the mark when it comes to taste but 80% food items were amazing and tasty too.  Love this place
Amazing food quality..sply want to mention d fine hospitality by Mr Tushar and other servicing staff...heaven for foodies.

A buffet restaurant that is well managed. Staff is courteous. Chicken items were delicious. Loved the food.

The dosa here is the best meal to have in winters. Also the pao bhaji was so buttery and creamy. Perfect pocket friendly space
Ordered tikki, bhalle papdi ,papdi chaat and gol gappe,  tikki was so crispy and so tastyüòçüòç also at a reasonable price, i loved the crispy papdi chaat,and dahi bhalle were also good,1 thing i didnt like was gol gappe,they might taste better if eaten at the restaurant who knows. But tikki and papdi chaat are a must try :)
Ordered raj kachori from them but the taste was not up to the mask , please consider this as a feedback not a a complain . And try to improve your recepie , the perfect one i have ever has is at Bikanerwala , in front of that this one was nothing
""
Dominos is my all time favourite, I always visit dominos that I have never been to Pizza Hut. Golden corn is my absolute favourite. It‚Äôs so cheesy and topped with golden corn. It‚Äôs just the best. Crust is so good. Staff is also very polite.
""
Visited this Domino's outlet after a movie in Punjabi bagh. We thought of trying out their new World Tour pizzas, we ordered the English Cheddar Cheese Pizza and garlic breadsticks with cheesy dips. The Pizza had cheddar cheese in good quantity and toppings of mushrooms & onions. The base I chose was Fresh Pan, which is always better than the normal one. The Pizza taste was good. There could have been a bit of more sauces involved, but maybe the English like it this way. The breadsticks were awesome as always. The service was quick & the staff was polite too.

Didn't like their pizzas at all. No cheese. Not even thin crust

I ordered a veg Deluxe thali. It can easily be shared between 2 people. Everything was good. The quantity was a whole lot. Good packaging.
This place is located in Moti Nagar market which is not really accessible due to high traffic on the road where this place is. The food is okayish not really good. They deliver or you can takeaway, there is no sitting available. It is near metro station too. I had ordered twice just to give chance because food wasn‚Äôt upto the mark on my first try. It‚Äôs been a long time I had food here.

I visit this super cool awesome place to send some good time with my loved ones yes i selected this place to spent some good tim and my decision was turned out so oerfect perfect place to have some good & yummy food and the best i love the shakes every single shakes we order is sooo soooo good in taste and presentation as well also all my friends love the food ,ambience ,taste as well and we visit more & more in future üòç
This is one place we love too much. Especially their fancy shakes and coolers are worth trying! This place offers good service, and some real tasty and scrumptious food. We have tried the Mother-in-law Fries and it tasted heavenly tasty.¬† The spices and sauces used are quite well to go with the food.¬† They also provide take away service in the same glasses which is really cool!
Blackjack located in Punjabi Bagh has cute little ambience. The place is a little too small to accommodate many people but I would like to say that the food is so amazing and satisfying. I first tried this place out because i have heard so many good reviews about the fries they serve. They are very particular about their presentation which makes the food look all the more tempting. I had fries it was really amazing, fries were crispy and loaded with cheese. Then I had sliders , alfredo pasta the ingredients was just so much balanced that attracts my taste bud and lastly I had kitkat shake which was too thick. The food was too delicious . I really loved the sweet containers they‚Äôd for takeaway, which are reusable. It has the best dishes in it's menu and you can try almost anything.
Great ambience, Great Food, Great Service, Friendly Staff. Everything is perfect here. Will definitely go back to this place especially on weekends

This cafe is One of my favourite lounges in West Delhi. It is located on the main road of Punjabi Bagh club road. The decor and interiors were eye catching. They also has a terrace sitting arrangement and is also great for clicking pictures. Coming to the food, they have so many options to choose from, it takes quite some time to decide. At first we had few cocktails and after that we had few starters, like paneer tikka, chicken tikka and chilly chicken is delecious. I really liked their butter chicken with naan. A very classy place for a date, the price is very good considering the offering and quantity being served.

Ordered food through their app ..no food delivered ..no refund..payment was done online..their contact no.not working.I request Zomato to upload their correct contact no.
Ordered food on 11.10.2019 through the Midnight Hunger Hub app. No food delivered and no refunds made till date. Highly unprofessional thugs.
Order food on 12.10.19 through their app . Payment was done in advance through card. Still no food no refund no response received till now. Contact numbers too are not working.
Perfect treat for Midnight hunger. We ordered spaghetti arrabbiata which was perfectly cooked with perfect sauce served with garlic breads and malai tandoori chaap which was one of the best we have ever had. The packing was wonderful with proper chutney‚Äôs cutleries and napkins. Recommendation - 4/5 Taste - 4/5 Price - 3.5/5
I placed an order of Rs. 872 on 15th September through the Midnight Hunger App and my order was not accepted, I have neither received the order nor the refund. I‚Äôve been trying to contact you people through all the phone numbers available online, unfortunately have not received any response. Kindly guide me how can I get the refund. This is extremely unprofessional, if Midnight Hunger Hub is not functional, you need to update it online so nobody places an order.  I‚Äôd really appreciate your help, kindly resolve the matter. I have attached the pictures including the Order ID for your reference.
Loved there kit kat shake, pizza üçï, pasta and everything soo very delicious, pasta is over priced tho.
The manager at the restautant will never solve your complaints . Food smells .
Been here for the 1st time. Loved the food. A little on the expensive side but totally worth it. Being a hot chocolate lover , I really liked this one the best. Pizza and burger were also great. We ordered paneer pizza and veg burger. I liked the thing that they served peri peri chicken wings with fries and salad.
Cheesy and great collection of food menu! Good choice of pasta and sandwiches! @sahaj

We ordered chicken tikka pizza from this place. They offer amazing quality and service at an affordable price. Looking forward to visiting this place again to try more variety of Pizza.
A nice and cozy place to enjoy Italian food. I have been here many times. The food here is really good. A wide variey of pizzas are available in many sizes. I had Rome style pizza and Exotic veg lasagne. Food- 4/5 (Taste and Quality) Ambience- 3/5 Service- 3/5
Recently went to punjabi bagh and was searching to try something different. So went there it is just adjacent to black jack and have a huge variety of items It is known for their pizzas and indeed it is good too. But i have tried better pizzas too. Then i tried the Alfredo pasta which was quite tasty and authentic just i preferred a bit more sauce in it. Otherwise would recommend to go there for some authentic Italian food
One of the best places to enjoy good quality pizza. It's bit expensive but worth it. The place is however bit too small, limited seating. But the food was great.
I loved all the veg pizzas that this place has to offer, I have been here more than a couple of times and have loved it everytime.
The place with great ambience and best satisfying food!! This place is good for dinner and many more .Enjoy their sufi night..good music ! The crowd is also amazing .
Nope, never going again! Sorry, I mean how can there be mosquitos there! Below the table, they were biting us all the time. We asked waiter to help us on this, but no luck
Absolutely love this place . I always go for a dinner. This place is packed and yes makes great food. Everything from Shawarma, tofalafel toplatters and dips & chips is amazing and fresh. Price are cheap not much higher !
Ambience is average according to me. Food is good in taste. You can enjoy here with your friends and also organize parties here. Drinks are also available here.
Had mixed experience .. The food was fine .. I prefer masabaa‚Äôs fine dine more than the lounge .. The buffet was average .. But the music was good ..
Broooooo this place has damn damn damn good pork. Tried the pork ribs and it was lip smacking good. 1st was given a small piece and den second order a bigger rib which was a mistake because it is freaking heavy. The masala is bloody tasty, no 2 ways about it.  Ordered the beef chilly which was ok. Frankly it didn't tickle my bones as it doesn't taste like the authentic beef chilly.  Also ordered the sausage rice which wasn't that great. Was ok. I mean for a first timer you will like it or even love it but if you're from a family of awesome goan cooks you'll know what im talking about.  Place is nice. Good ambience. Owner is nice and sweet. He knows his place around food so yeah you can ask him for the best order according to your taste.  Place closes at 11 but last order is at 10.30. will definately go back here for the beef steak in the afternoon as I wana taste it missed it dis time.  Try it out guys the best food is in the remotest place it's a proven fact.
Superb food, we took lots of food from here as a take away as we were having a party at our villa.   Trust me no one spoke to each till the time they were gorging on the food. Great stuff!   Tried: beef chilly & Chicken roast. Both were cooked to perfection and had great flavour.   FYI they have a lovely outdoor seating can accommodate large groups as well.   Definitely going there again.
Are lunch here last Sunday. Went with two friends. We were pretty much the only crowd there apart from one other family. Very homely atmosphere and super friendly host. While the pork solantle was superb, the pork chops blew our mind. It was easily the best pork I have ever had in my life. The meat was super tender and had absorbed the marinade so well. We left with a heavy tummy but with a feeling of immense content. Hope to visit here soon.
Visited Andron's on the 26th of Dec. This is the second time I have eaten here and it's never disappointing. If you're a first timer and not Goan,Uncle Tony (Owner), will be more than glad to assist you in picking their signature dish but not without trying out their Feni with Ginger Ale first. He makes you feel at home right from the moment you enter till you say your last goodbye.¬† This time when I was there,we tried the Beef Chilly Fry with Poi(Local Goan Bread), Pork Solantle(A simple pork dish made from Onions and Kokum) and yet has so much flavor to it and the Pork Vindaloo. We had this with the Sanan's.¬† It's a hidden gem in Nachinola-Aldona and google maps will take you straight there.
Well, coming back for the fish and seafood since given a temporary crisis in Goa, there was no fish available for small places like this. This is a single man operation, running from his home I presume. The living room has been converted to a nice bar and some very basic tables & chairs to seat about 12 people. So we basically had PORK! Lots of pork. And beer!  We ate Ard Mas (a first for me) which was just an exceptional dish. While his roast pork (marinated in red wine) is quite famous, I think it was having an off day when I went. And the chicken roast was pretty average. The pork vindaloo won the day, and the Pork Solantle is worth another visit.  This is a hidden gem, so please share wisely and scarcely!
Its great place to be in, the lunch was so light that we could not stop eating. Desserts were like you will never end up eating them. The mushroom rice that we ordered although had single serving but made two stomachs full. Staff was courteous and the ambience was nice change to goa outlook.
I visited this place yesterday, food was really tasty . I was satisfied like the food was healthy and way of delivering was fantastic, you can also order at your on place , and price is also good. This place if highly recommended. Will make sure to visit again
Cute bistro serving some delicious food! As a group we ordered quite a few mains but I think my favourite was the veg lasagne! Also their Sangria üëå
A very fancy and expensive place but really worth the visit. Also try Sangria ‚ô•Ô∏è

On Monday we were in Panjim and didn‚Äôt know what to do for lunch. We have visited George‚Äôs, Martin‚Äôs corner and Ritz Classic multiple times over the years. So this time when we used  internet to see the best places in Panjim. And we found this place rated 4.5 in zomato trip advisor and google. Looking at the reviews we decided to drop in for lunch. The restaurant had just opened and in no time it was packed. We got the corner table so we could sit and enjoy the food. The ambiance was amazing lot of antiques displayed. It‚Äôs a small place but very comfortable. We ordered for coconut fenny with 7up, along with kokum made with coconut milk. Both the drinks were really nice. For starters we ordered for   Butter garlic squid  Phodi - Vangi (sliced brinjal coated in Rawa and fried   Bombil fry - Bombayduck Rawa fry  The famous in this place Fish thali -severed with a portion of rice, sheer fish gravy in  Harwo Masala( green masala) , Bangda teppal ambat, sungta dangar, veg sides, kismoor (prawn), spicy kokum, salad, pickle and Slice of sheer fish Rawa fry.  A must visit place I liked this way better than Ritz Classic.  #seafoodlove #konkancusine #goanfood #goanfoodblog #panjimgoa #couplegoals #foodies #foodphotography #foodblogger #koknikanteengoa
The food was simply delicious and mouth watering!! Went during dinner time which was full of rush. Had to wait for 15 mins to get a table. Ordered A-la- carte prawn curry, rice and king fish fry and sol kadi. It was simply superb.
One of the very popular places to have goan food! The ambience is cozy and comfortable. They have a short menu, but serves best food.  Starters - ‚Ä¢Fresh fish fry ( Pomfret) - Being in goa, the fish had to be fresh and was also cooked till perfection ‚Ä¢Golden prawns - They were dipped in batter and deep fried ‚Ä¢Peanut fry - Bolied peanuts were served with onion, tomato, corriander and some condiments.  Maincourse - ‚Ä¢Prawns curry - Tasted ultimate (¬Æ) ‚Ä¢Kokni sukha chicken - The gravy was had a perfect taste ‚Ä¢Kaju green peas bhaji - The kaju being the king, was cooked good and served well  Dessert - ‚Ä¢Goa's best Cerdura - One of my personal favorites from the entire list. The traditional ceradura they serve is one of the things that you should definitely taste! (¬Æ¬Æ)

I waited for one hour but it was worth it and I wouldn't mind waiting next time the rawa fried king fish thali was exceptional loved every bit of it crab was very good nothing was bad
Lovely food..great ambience..savu took good care of us
We fell in love with the place - the food was amazing, staff was so courteous and warm and the ambience was something we'd never seen before. The dining experience was one of the best we had in Goa till date!
""
Food is yummy and best part is Service... Prosenjit was taking order and he was polite as well as gave good suggestions to choose the food as per our request... Really loved the food and service...
Food is awesome. But too costly. üò¨
You can go out with your friends and have dinner lunch breakfast it‚Äôs quite enough for parties birthday parties wedding anniversary is much like family partyYou can enjoy a date with your girlfriend food is very cheap and best quality
The most recommended place for sea food in entire goa. The sea food thali is the most sought after item there and it comes loaded with fish, prawns in dry and gravy style. The best and most suggested item will the crabs. I had crabs butter garlic and it was the best butter garlic crab I have ever had. The servers are so polite and the ambience is super comfortable. Looking forward to visit again when I am back in goa
Visited the Ritz restaurant on 18th June road to have some starters and their most talked about thali. When we asked the waiter he said we don't serve thali in the evening and he was directing us to another Ritz outlet where thali was available. So we had a beer and ordered some crumb fried mussels. The mussels were stale not fresh. Definitely didn't expect this from a place which is most talked about for it's seafood. Konkani canteen is way better.
Had heard a lot of this place so travelled 15km from Calangute to Panaji to have a fish thali here. There was a waiting of more than 30mins and that increased my expectations of this place. However, all the excitement turned to absolute disappointment when the thali was served. The plate had 5-6 bowls however the content was rubbish. The prawn curry had only 1 prawn. There was one bowl which had all fish bones only. The sol curry had no coconut milk. When we reached out to staff they said that bones was a mix fish curry. It appeared as if all the eaten fish bones were served with curry on it. The staff lied to us that there are no crabs today, but we seen it being served to others while we waited for seats. Later they confessed that crabs were over. The least that we could expect was an apology but that too was not served and the staff arrogantly stated that we will give a discount. Really disappointed with the food and the service. Not recommended.‚òπÔ∏è
We went in without prior booking, had to wait for just a few minutes when a very pleasant waiter ushered us in and took our orders giving us helpful suggestions regarding my queries regarding some dishes.  We orders the Fish Thali and golden fried prawns which came in quick despite the full house. The prawns were perfectly marinated not oily at all in the cornflower batter and the sauce too was great.  The Fish Thali was huge with each dish on it better than the last one. The baby crabs were perfect in the delicate coconut gravy, the rava fry was a huge slice of King fish perfectly marinated and crisp, the prawn gravy had a delicious creamy coconut base. The kokum was one of the best I have had lately and the sweet vermicelli was creamy and perfectly sweetened.  Must visit if one is in Panjim, cheers to the staff who had a smile despite the constant flow of hungry customers who were more than happy to wait to come in and dine.
I visited this place yesterday, food was really tasty . I was satisfied like the food was healthy and way of delivering was fantastic, you can also order at your on place , and price is also good. This place if highly recommended. Will make sure to visit again
Cafe cum Bakery with outdoor sitting of an art gallery in the Hill top of Althino in panaji. Good place to chill in Panaji and the ambiance is all green and peaceful.
Loved the place, specially how its located in an old bunglow. The ambience is lovely. coming to the food, i tried their sunny side up on herbed biscuit and salted caramel almond milkshake and they were absolutely delicious. This cafe is a must visit when in Goa.

Great Goan eatery offering authentic goan Food. Usually this place is bustling with tourists during meal hours. Service is fast and food is amazing. Loved their BBQ prawns in White sauce and pork sausage chilli. Been here many times and will keep coming for more. Thank you to the owner Linda!!

Best food in panjim! Try the prawn curry rice
Great food in a old three storied house , the service was impeccable and even though we got seated in the third floor waiter came often to check on us, great for sea food and Goan dishes
The small package that this magnificent place comes in only adds to the feel of this place. The service is fast and at the top level. The taste steals the thunder the moment you immerse in the ambiance. A great place for you to go if you love Goan food any food on plate for that matter.
Established in 1997 Mum‚Äôs Kitchen has preserved the authentic Goan recipes by traveling to the far corners of Goa and learning it from the women who have been passed down this knowledge from their mothers.There are no chefs at Mum's kitchen, rather the food is prepared by the local Goan women, giving you the dishes that taste of flavourful nostalgia. Mums Kitchen gives a¬†  feeling of being out in nature rather than in the heart of Panaji as you are surrounded by the luscious greenery. You experience the true Goan vibes in the decor, with the Goan styled tiled tables, plates, tradional ragda and photographs that adorn the wall. The staff is impeccably trained and greet you with a smile. It always feels good when your work is rewarded and that can be seen by all the awards that are adorned on their wall. The menu is lists out Goan specials, it is personalised with each dish being named after the person who provided the recipe. We tried the following dishes from the menu:  Kombdechem Sukhem: This is a recipe obtained from the Goan ghats. The Chicken pieces are cooked in a tangy tamarind gravy which is subtly spiced. This is a dish that I would¬† highly recommend, as every mouthful is an enriching experience.  Bharleli Keli: It is a fusion of modern and traditional cooking. The sweet Moira bananas are stuffed with a salty green chutney, the sweet salty taste compliment each other well, slight crunch is provided by being fried in semonlina.  Solantule: Pork is¬† cooked in semi dry masala with slight sounress brought out by the sola, it is paired up well with a crunchy salad.  Tisryanche Sukhem: A Goan classic, the clams cooked in dry spices with grated coconut.¬†  ‚ÄúVilasniche Hooman‚Äù: The dish is named after its maker Vilasni, it is a Hindu way of preparing the Prawn curry. The addition of ladyfinger gives a nice flavor to the coconut based curry.  Crepe Mum: Definitely a must try if you have a sweet tooth. The pancake is light and fluffy, topped with ice cream and chocolate, the addition of jaggery and coconut elevate the dish while the cashew nuts provide a nice crunch.

It was a delightful experience and we were served well by Rex Oliveira! Food was scrumptious and the pomphret fish curry is a must-try!
It is truly mum‚Äôs kitchen. Everything is served with great love. We went there on bike so no idea how parking works. Very well located, easy to find. Being vegetarian I was not disappointed, Mahesh the man of wonder helped to choose food. I liked everything that I ate, specially Foddi, Batat kalimiri, Veg khatkhatem, Veg xacuti, and drinks
Great food and hospitality. Special mention to Rex and his awesome recommendations.
Love the Boho ambiance of this place. It reminds me of the contemporary cafe‚Äôs in the US. A good place to hangout with friends. The best past is that the place is very casual where there are books to read, colours to paint and board games to play. Not to forget the guitar! Coming to the food, all the dishes that I‚Äôve tasted are simply amazing. The best ones are the BBQ Burger, MCR, Cheesy fries. You can also try the chicken fingers. I love the Mojito out here. It‚Äôs truly refreshing. Greatly recommended!
Best Chicken Burger for the price. Also the ice tea and virgin mojito were amazing !  Amazing place to chill with friends.  Recommended for Burger lovers..
""
Their paneer BBQ burger is to die for! Oozing with BBQ sauce and a nice, thick slab of paneer, it's totally VFM. The sandwiches are good, too. The veg burgers (have only tried those since I'm vegetarian) are so good that I periodically get cravings for them! Very affordable food and drinks. Superb cafe overall!
This place was great. We didn't know what we wanted for lunch so we tried this please out. Food was great and the staff was easy going and attentive...We definitely plan to be back.
The food was amazing. And the prices are also reasonable. During my trip to Goa. The best Chinese i had was at TAO. No where else I got such perfect Chinese food in goa. The location is also nice. Easy to locate.
lots to say about this place....lets start with the -¬† Ambiance: a nicely tucked away restaurant on the Main Street, its a quiet space. But the inside I think is too dark. It takes the mood away  Food: Asian food which I think is average....good choice on the menu. We ordered chicken fried rice, there was hardly any chicken. We also had some noodles from their noodle festival, they hardly had any flavour.¬†  Service: Good service, all the staff are always around, courteous, helpful and friendly.  Value for Money: No...we think its definitely quiet expensive for both Panji and Goa!!¬†  Worth going once to check out the place but its nothing more than average!!
Absolutely Amazing food after stopping by for a drink in the afternoon. Excellent service lovely service  Highly recommended!  Would love to visit again
One the bestest Asian cuisine I have ever been ...the food is finger licking...In starters v went on to Malaysian popiah and tangy chilli ,chicken Momo's and latseun ...v could feel each ingredients in it the taste is outstanding ..one shuld definitely try it out ..they have variety of dishes ...the servicmg was great too..And the low lighting ambience gives you really gud vibe ..a place must to visit for it's amazing food...
Amazing food. Loved the Chilly Basil noodles along with stir fry veggies.
We visited this place on weekday. The place wasnt packed at all when we arrived. Atleast for first 5 minutes no one was there to take the order. We ordered special fish thali, prawns rava fry. The thali was below average for the price they charged. It consisted of some mediocre fish curry, green peas curry,dry fish kismoor,clams sukka, slice of fried snapped,kokum kadi,rice and roti. The only commendable thing was the prawns which was cooked well and deveined too. But the thali was bland and tasteless. Wish the guys could do better with their service staff and enhance the flavours in thier fish thali.
This hotel is overrated and quality was of  food is not up to mark. We have tried couple of dishes like Fish Thali and prawn chilli however the quality of food is not justifies the hotel rating.
Very very baid service and kharab food I hate this restaurant
asowme
Not worth the visit to this place. Ordered fish thali nothing so great. The waiter is just waiting for you to finsh your meal and to push u out of the door. Try someother better places in mapusa

Excellent place to hangout with your friends. Great ambience to enjoy football & cricket matches. Sea is amazing. Good old Goan interior.
We have tried egg fried rice, paneer tikka masala, mushroom manchurian, chicken lollipop, dal fry. Order online & everything was great. Their food doesn‚Äôt have dripping oil like other popular joints.
A good place for having Goan fish thali. Good portions of food. Service could hav been bit faster considering there wasn't much crowd when we visited. Ambience-4/5 Food-4/5 Service-4/5 Value for money-4/5
I‚Äôm so in love with this place! It totally gives goan vibe! Took my fiends here for lunch and they simply loved it. I was so unsure of taking them her but I‚Äôm glad I did. Amazing fish thali ever. Seafood was so good! And really affordable. The place is very nice and superb ambience. A good restaurant in mapusa!
My personal favorite was the croquettes here.... can‚Äôt stop eating.  And the best thing is whatever you don‚Äôt eat they take it back and subtract it from the bill. So you get to pet only for what you ate, this no wastage!  Ambience: 3 Taste: 4 Value for money: 4 Service: 4
Loved the beef steak and beef cutlet. Good food!
My favorite joint for snacks when in Goa. The beef croquet are yummm so are the other snacks. The staff is polite. Ambience was OK.
Been years since I went in. Saw one familiar face among the waiters. Had the mix bhaji and snacks. The bhaji was ok. The snacks kind of disappointed. The beef puff had a sour taste. The samosa was oily. The egg chops were great. I have to admit this is a sentimental score.
Value for money and good food. Must try chilly chicken.

I am having food with my family and 4yrs boy. During lunch found live spider in pulao rice, when we inform and try to meet manager but no one came to meet us neither any one bother to apologise. Server came and say will change. Absulately zero satisfaction.
Actually It wasn't biryani, It was masala pulav, which they serve at cheap weddings. The whole restaurant smelled like it was near some open drainage chamber, or maybe they must have evacuated it when we were present at the restaurant. Had the worst experience of my life.
Great food and amazing service by pradeep

I ordered for a chicken and sausage pizza and it was very salty and no taste it was better that I had to order my regular chicken burger from cremeux
""
We went on a Tuesday evening, so there was little to no crowd at all. We ordered Potato wedges, Cheese garlic bread & cold coffee to wash it down. Service is good. Food quantity is better than expected. Potato wedges were appropriately baked.
I gave this place many chances but sadly all has failed. Most of the times I've had stale pizzas, WATERY cold coffee, etc. I'm never coming back again.
My go to place when I need to buy cakes and snacks  for any occasion. Pizza‚Äôs are also good and cheesy. This particular branch as courteous staff as well. They are open till 11pm and the kitchen closes at 10:30pm. Iv had a good experience every time I have visited this branch. Overall satisfied. !
Visited this place for a quick lunch.Usually I had heard this place was well known for their seafood and Thali but was amazed when I tried their Chicken biryani.The spices were to the point and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Food- 4/5 Ambience- 3.5/5 Service - 3.5/5  Would definitely love to visit this place to try their Seafood.
Had a horrible experience at this hotel today... Deceiving pictures of the fish thali displayed at the entrance... Actual thali missed 2 to 3 items. Higher authorities including the manager was not available to adress the grieviences... Ground staff was trying to cover up...!!! Dissapointing!!!
Have been here once, The ambience and restaurant interiors are good. Though they aren't very good at Goan cuisine and also takes up a lot of time in getting and serving the order.
Food is terrible.they can't make a simple soup.the first time in my life i had a cream of mushroom soup with garlic n a layer of oil floating on the surface. It tasted like diluted butter Garlic.Guys change ur chef or please shut down.If u need skilled chefs please contact me.
The place is nice, the staff is very courteous and well serving, however the foods needs a bit of touch up. Im Goa if you cant get your butter chicken right 60 % customers are gone. Work on food menu and youre sorted!

Goan special food üòã Finally fish thali as we wanted to try the most recommended food in Goa  It was a special experience to have fish thali here in Goan spice
A lively pretty place for fish lovers. Their buttered prawns and prawn biryani is a must have. Absolutely delicious. Do not miss their Mojito as it is the best I have ever had. If you want to have a relaxed time with great food and easy at the pocket...this is the place to be.
The food is great and the ambience is pleasant! The egg biryani could have had more added spices as the name 'goan spice' suggests, and can be served with a raita. The curd rice needs to have more curd in it. The prices of the food and drink were very affordable. The seafood is amazing here. A must try include the 'prawns koliwada' 'fish thali'. The flavours are wonderful. Will definitely visit again.
One of the best goan restaurant i have come across. I make it a point to eat there every time i visit goa. Everything in the menu is amazing. The are priced reasonably, the service is great. I wish i could pick one thing that was better then the other for recommendations but everything is Amazing! Go for it when in Goa !

Worst food , fried rice with plain rice and some chicken, tasteless, and fish thali, the kingfish is like paper, worst quality food, stopped ordering or eating there
Not sure about any other dishes but indeed they serve lovely chicken' biryani . The ambiance to add the to lovely dinning . The hospitality is also commendable . Indeed a must visit for Mapusa residents during a weekend ‚ô•
Visited on 6 June 2019 for some food and beverages. Food: Ordered for cheese garlic naan, masala kulcha, Surmai fry, squids fry, dal tadka, rice. All food was great but dal tadka was quite disappointing. Service: The restaurant is jam packed may be that's why service gets delayed in terms of food. Overall: The food served here is very good but they miss consistency as the taste changes everytime I visit here.

This is our go to place for hangouts and get togethers from college. The menu is extensive and is decently priced. My favourites here are the Paneer Pasanda and Chicken Patiala. The fish thali is also good. They also provide pick up and drop services from various places. Surely one of the best restaurants in and around Bicholim and Sanquelim.
Worst experience ever. They are confused about their own dishes. No management to even complain. Bland and taste less. Don't stop here ever.
I won't complain about the food but the service at the restaurant is not good. The person who took our order was easily irritable and rude. He lingered around when we were eating and didn't show any etiquette and was rude. Authority please take some action. We had visited the restaurant on 11/5/19
""
Starting with food , it was below par. Ambiance was kind of good. Staff and service was bad. Order took too much time. Ordered chicken biryani they gave us jeera rice with chicken pieces. I suggest go on fast food rather than this restaurant.
This restaurant is excellent and don't judge by the photos! I had the veg kadhai which is probably the best I've ever had in my life. The prawns curry was amazing too and cheese garlic naan is to die for! Looking fwd to visiting this place often! I've heard the chicken soup is great as well!
Our go-to place for weekend dinners. It's a family restaurant with a shack-like decor. But the food is good (especially the non vegetarian fare). What's praiseworthy is the freshness of the ingredients. The chicken is usually moist and not rubbery. They also serve a variety of sea food. The prices are decent and it's a great escape from our cafeteria food üòõ
I visited this place for dinner with a couple of friends. This place is located just next to the Mayem Lake. We ordered prawn rava fry and one chicken starter ( Cannot recollect the name :P ) and veg crispy.. The non veg starters were good but the veg crispy was just okay. We ordered naan and chicken do pyaaza. Both of these were pretty good. The portions are good and the service is pretty fast. The ambience is also decent. A paisa vasool place and it does offer good veg options.
""
Goa being my native place I am always skeptical about trying new places out Wondering if i would get the same authentic taste. But here...It is!üòç Perfectly cooked fresh food. Polite staff, Reasonable prices and Ambiance was cherry on a pie. We ordered Prawns biryani 6/5üòã And Chicken 4/5 Worth it.. ! Totally!
The Best Quality food in the Bicholim City
If not that, you can opt for the fish thali. They are one of the very few restaurants in Bicholim that serves the traditional Goan thali for lunch and dinner. The humble thali comprises of the usual ‚Äì steamed rice, fish or prawn curry, fried fish, tisreo sukhem, kokum curry, dry prawn kismoor and a dessert. They even have a chicken thali, which is customised to your palette.
Bicholim is a relatively undiscovered area in Goa. The Village is beautiful and green. Adarsh is one small restaurant located near the main market of the village. It is a two floored restaurant with the first floor being a non ac section and the first being the ac, family room. We stepped into the family room. The waiter was relatively uninterested and told us to go sit at a table of our choosing. We ordered a simple fare, roti and chicken. We tried the Chicken A-la Adarsh. The dish that came wasn't appealing in any way. However, never judge a book by it's cover. The dish was truly amazing in taste. If anyone is near Bicholim, do stop at Adarsh restaurant for this dish.
Pocket friendly place to fill your tummy, been here with my colleagues and since they are avid seafood lovers they ordered loads of fish varieties and it looked awesome as well as tasted too according to them. Ambience is like a dhaba on a highway but food is what brings you back to this place again and again.
A place which will definitely satisfy u at lunch time.. special for their thalis.. everything looks home made.. even the water which is served is like at home.. small place with AC and non AC sections.. bit difficult to find.. but one of the places to be in Bicholim.. kingfish thali and limbu soda is recommended... Theirs tisryanche tondak and prawn's kismoor are mouth watering And we got free ice cream too... Yey
Small joint. Haven't tried much food here but yes samosa and Limbu soda as we call it is a must try. In a place where there are hardly many top end restaurants. This small eatery makes way to my stomach just with the Limbu soda. Yet to be explored cuz of the many reviews I got from my hubby.
Truly amazing food.one of the best place i have ever been in goa just for food. Food is very good.dont have much food options but u wont miss home made food aftr being here
Annapurna Bhojanalaya¬† As the name suggests is truly Annapurna. The place is quite small with Ac and Non ac sections available. The menu is subject to availability of fish so the fish thali is subject to change as per availability. ¬†The veg thali contains a whole lot of items in smaller quantities. Just like your Maharaja Bhog in Mumbai but in Goan style. Major Fish items are been fried with rawa to acquire that goan taste even the potato is been fried the same way. The veg meal contains Rice, Dal, Dahi, Aamti, Sol kadi, Potato fried, Mirchi Bhaji, Some vegetable and koshimbir, kairi and Papad.¬† While the non veg menu contains Rice, fish curry, aamti, sol kadi, Fish for the day( fried), Kairi, koshimbir, vegetable and papad.  The vanilla ice cream is complimentary for every thali. The service is slow. If you order at 12.30 pm it will be served at 12.50 pm. But patience is what worth it. You will be completely satisfied with the quality & quantity of the food. It's away from the bus stand but accessible via a car or scooter.¬†  Total value for money is my final word. If prawns are the fish for the day then it taste's like best prawn meal thali ever.
Really enjoyed our meals here coming back for lunch.Particularly impressed by the friendly and helpful staff who pointed using the direction of the best food choices. Much more reasonably priced than near by hotels and great quality.
I like their food. It's pure veg restaurant. It's the best option for me when I'm too lazy too cook. Their veg kurma in particular and the thali is good too. Also the batata vada is served with awesome chutney. Very affordable prices too. Simple and sober food.
A great snacking place. Everything is available from a samosa to a thali. My personal favorites might include the South Indian dishes here and the coffee. Do remember, this place shuts around 7 PM if not mentioned anywhere else.
not worth it, if you are veggie and can manage to eat in non veg serving restaurant then there are certainly better options in bicholim, keep this place as last option.¬† Also they always have issues with change and the counter is full of toffy's, you know what i mean they give toffy in place of change, once i asked them to write on the bill the remaining amount, then the person on the counter opened another drawer and gave me exact change....
South Indian evening snacks spot. Not much to eat here. A standard lunch veg thali at reasonable rate. Not great place to have dinner at all.
Decent price. It's typical fast food stall food made small restaurant. Good for hangout eatings. They have got two location for seating one open street view seating on ground floor and other closed view with 2-3  exhaust for you to breath some air in on first floor.
This outlet is situated inside a bakery in Bicholim named om Prasad bakery.. there is no sitting available.. only thing good abt this is availability of cakes and other things which are not much found in areas around Bicholim..don't go with any expectations..
There was a time when this was one of the best places to sit.. now have become very bad.. although u get modarat food.. bar and ac section is still present on top sitting.. but better to go to some other places in Bicholim

A nice place to start off your day with a smile, this place not only offers alacarte menu but they also have a buffet for morning breakfast, had visited this place for one of their morning buffets, the price was quite reasonable but the dishes they were offering didn't seem that catchy, there was a spread of south Indian breakfast delicacies, eggs (Made according to your preferences), some fresh juices and to finish it of, some pancakes and waffles.  The eggs tasted quite good and was the best part of this buffet, the buffet wasn't able to catch my attention because of their dishes. The fresh juices, tea and coffee kept the people happy and the desserts, the waffles and the pancakes were a complete let down. Both tasted very doughy and, even the maple syrup and the chocolate weren't able to overpower the taste of the dish. Overall since this place is also a hotel I wasn't really expecting too much from it. Some food dishes were quite good.  Ambience 4/5 Food 3.5/5 Recommended 3.5/5
One of the best places for great breakfasts.. ravishing ambience, amazing food and welcoming staff...music was light and good.. din't taste the desserts today but I've heard they are amazing!!
I often visit to Goa. But visit to this Cafe was a recommendation from a dear friend. To my surprise this place turned out to be best place in Goa for food and ambience.Specially Priya who always wanted to make us comfortable and her suggestion on food turned out to be great.
This cafe is small and cute. Nicely done ambience.  We had fish and chips, tamarind chicken, chocolate cake here.  Fish and chips was really yum. Best part of the meal was cake here. It was out of the world. They offer so many varieties of cakes.
Good place for breakfast and full meal... Bar things also available.. Highly recommended for solo travelers
Hands down , the best meal we had in Goa. This tourism state can be heavy on your pocket with respect to food.  However, on our way back from Aarambol beach , we decided to try the south Indian combo here as we were homesick after the initial 4 days.  We ordered kingfish thali, chicken thali, special chicken thali and a veg thali.  They were sumptuous and flavourful. The service was quick and polite. They did serve alcohol.  Please try their fruit salad with ice cream because I'm still looking for something like that in Bangalore. It was simply heavenly.  Each thali was an average of around 160 INR.  Before I forget mentioning the ambience, it might not be sea facing, but it's definitely calm and a peaceful setting.
A great place with super fast service and great taste.The prices are worth for any tourist.If you are around,this place is a must.Its super quite too !
If you want the best food, then I know a place that just fits the bill and that is A1 food and beverages. On the main road of Arambol and Mandrem, this hotel serves the best food and the service is top class.   While the evenings are very relaxing here ( I was almost addicted to evenings at A1 but had to give up because I had to go to other beaches, but I started to compare the quality, quantity and pricing of food at other restaurants against A1 and, hands down, its A1 all the way )  If you are in Arambol, Mandrem, Morjim, look no further than A1 food and beverages.
Visited arambol in Goa, India and looked out for a restaurant that is within budget yet, great food and lively enviroment. Came across A1 food and beverages. On a scale of 10, this is how I rate :  Food - 9/10 Speed of service - 9/10 Enviroment - 9/10 Very casual enviroment  Cuisines - Indian, Tandoori, afghani, tibetan, chinese, continental, seafood and the local cuisines.  Evenings at A1 is what I loved the most as I had the company of wine, romantic songs and the just perfect amount of lights.
Wow.... It's was amazing food and cocktail üçπ we had ordered chicken crisp and French fries üçü and vodka lemonade... Taste was so great and I m surely recommend it... Thx for chef Velly... We see u soon.... üòò üòò üòò üòò Lot of love
I have to say, we've been receive late at night, and we were the only costumer.The restaurant before just close and it was about 10 PM. We've been receive very kindly by all the family. We had some nice talk together¬† and he wanted to serve us every dish... By the way, they were super good not because we were angry but they were super nice. So thanks to you guys, you are in our hearts....
Awsome food....Calamari batter fry,recheado,tandoor and spicy gravy....yumüòãüòã Nice ambience... and setup.. to have food with family and friends. cheers...üç∫üç∫
Very good place , nice ambeince, good music .must try goan seafood and cocktails....best place to sit and enjoy the evening with friends!! Recomended!!üëçüèª
This place is peaceful and refreshing.If you want to spend good time with your loved one and also want to enjoy bit of music this place is nice.i would not mention any particular dish however their all dishes are excellent¬† e.g. Northern, Goan.
Located on the most beautiful stretch in the length and breadth of goa as per me.  This place is one of my favourite for sunset shots as it shows off a huge and abundantly watered river, outlined by mangroves on one side and a beautiful Village Road on the other, a concrete highway kind of a bridge cuts right through the middle of the river making this place an ideal stop by sunset point for all travelling through or to here. Flor so mat is the big luxurious boat in this river serving delectable cuisine. Mouth watering snacks and amazing ambience.  This would be a perfect place to propose, throw an engagement party or any private party rich people can afford :)
Located in Morjim, this floating restaurant is in the river. The only way to reach this place is a boat which is provided by them. The boat ride was a little scary but quite adventurous. The restaurant is on a floating boat which is beautifully done up. The view and feel once you reach here is very calming and relaxing. The sunset here will definitely be amazing. Though I missed it this time. Not crowded at all. Ideal for a private party. It's a luxury sea lounge. I knew they served continental cuisine and was very happy to be here. But they have a very limited menu. We ordered the chicken croquettes, deep fried calamari, peri peri prawns, bruschetta and quesadillas. All of these were good but nothing different and innovative. The portions are less and price too expensive. A bit disappointed with the food as I had expected a lot from this place. But a visit to this place is recommended. It's a wonderful experience.
This place is located on the turtle beach road in Morjim. This is one of the first places which I have been to, that requires a boat ride, Coz the restaurant is situated in the middle of the river. The location and ambience is awesome. Since we visited the place for dinner, we couldn't see the scenery around the place. At this place, we ordered the tomato and basil soup, bruschetta, quesadilla, chicken croquets, deep fried calamari and grilled prawns in peri peri sauce. All of it was tasty and delicious, but it lacked creativity and the portions weren't a lot, as each and every dish was priced on the higher side. The service was prompt, that's Coz they had only two tables for the night. The overall experience was satisfactory and I would surely want to visit this place to see the day view.
"With such a picturesque view and great location to its credit, Flor Do Mar should ideally be part of big hotel chains like the Marriott, Vivanta etc. But that is the beauty of Goa, entrepreneurs keen for promoting travel and keeping those travellers well fed in scenic locations. I came to this place on a Saturday night. So this ""place"" is actually a boat and you have to be ferried here by a smaller boat. Not very crowded at all. We went to the upper deck but no music was playing there like the way it was on the lower deck. Coming to service, it was slow. They have a limited menu, given their kitchen is on the boat itself and I expected all the food preps to be of top notch in taste and presentation. I ordered a veg quesadillas, enchiladas. Going by my expectations, I was sure that this place would be great for continental and Mexican, so enchiladas in a teeny tiny roll was not expected at all! I thought, maybe a new presentation which was really great but less on quantity. Taste wise, not at all great! So I went on to taste my quesadillas after this let down. Thank God as they were fine, otherwise I would be starving. My friend tried the non-veg items like king fish, ricotta stuffed chicken and was disappointed as well. Price wise I had expected it to be north of anything I had seen in Goa as the venue was great and high expectations were set. But food not being that tasty, it was money down the river...sorry..drain :|"
The ambience is perfect ... We are IN the river, the scenic beauty is just perfect ... Though the menu is limited, the chef prepares it all for you ...  Food is lip smacking, worth the value
Thia was my 2nd visit to this resort , awsome location . tried various prwns nd fish..well cooked . love this place . though while having breakfast few flies were around but just cant help ,its an open area on beach.
"I can go on about this place. Had ordered a cold coffee. Half way through it found a fly in coffee.. the waiter justified it to be coffee powder.. and the at the billing the justification changed to ""this is an open place and we cant help about flying creatures"" which means either we don't know how coffee powder looks or we are blind to not see wasps swimming in my coffee since he said we almost finished the coffee an then told about it. The pizza was for RUSSIANs. I didnt know RUSSIANs prefer Burnt pizza base. And the Pastaa.... Now am getting sleepless nights because I forgot to ask which cuisine was it since it had onions.. like big big onions... and some weird sticks of herbs These people have guts to be on zomato. Guys please stay hungry and donate the money rather than wasting it here. No value for customer. Gross service. Gross food. Even gross attitude. How my heart aches to even rate them a star."
This is the most pathetic restaurant you can ever visit. The coffee in the photo is filled with flies and mosquitos. After complaining to the staff they said that we still have to pay. The argument was that it is coffee powder .... Like we don't know the difference.... The manager is a lady with no Cosmetic sense. The other items that we ordered were pizza and bruchetta. Now to tell in detail the bruchetta was toasted bread butter with oregano on it and pizza was so thick and tasteless that we could have played frizzbi with it and the claim of the waiter was that it is as per Russian cuisine. The food tastes like shitt and service is lame and hopeless. This is the most horrible hotel ever. Eat roadside but don't go to this hotel. U might come out with infections and health problems. The one star rating is also a lot as there is no lower mark than this. Frankly it deserves negative remarks only. I wish this hotel shuts down. And if I talk about the beach ambience ...it will open you to a lot of garbage filled beach. They don't even take the pains of cleaning it.
PATHETIC FOOD AND HORRIBLE SERVICE. Not only food quality is so bad but you will get add on bad behavior by staff and manager as a complementary on your visit. We ordered pizza and the quality was bad to which when we complaind to the manager she told that THIS TYPE OF PIZZA WE MAKE SPECIALLY FOR RUSSIAN PEOPLE. Please do visit this place if you are going with someone whom u hate the most. He/She will get a lesson for the entire life.  NOT AT ALL RECOMMEND!!!!!! I WISH I COULD GIVE ZERO STAR TO THIS HOTEL SPECIALLY AND SPECIFICALLY TO THE STAFF AND MANAGER!!!
It's actually on aswem beach. Review is based on my June visit ( off season) --->>>monsoon..  Monsoon is great time to visit aswem beach..  scenic .. beautiful ..  Now coming to the Reviewing..    Food here is not that great.. very less options for veggie. We visited the place in off season due to which some of the menu item were not available.  Only thing we enjoyed here , is it ambience. Right on the beach..    If you are looking for a place to sit on the aswem beach with some drinks, you can definitely try out this place.. I visited it in off season, that's y there no shacks. We were left with this restaurant only.   We enjoyed this place because of less crowd and rain..

Had a lovely time at On The Go's outlet in Porvorim. I tried the empanada and loved the flaky baked pastry just as much as the mildly spiced meaty filling inside. Apparently you're meant to squirt some lime on it before taking the next bite and that really made a difference to the taste. The causa was delicious but the best part of my experience was biting into the Buttifara - a delicious sandwich made with home made ham, lettuce, onion relish and mustard. Very very fresh and so filling! Do try the iced teas - the passionfruit one is lovely!
Wow...so happy to have found this place on  my way to the beach. They serve up great chilled sandwiches and salads ready to grab and takeaway. Super convenient, fresh and delicious !!! Totally recommend the Peruvian chicken, chicken peri peri , beef slaw or my favourite, the Mexican tuna. Iced coffees and teas too are super refreshing
Amazing food and refreeeeshing ice tea with different flavours , the owners ROCKS such a beautiful energy in that place  on the way to Ashwem, totally recommended!! 
Sandwiches and more fresh and delicious drinks that can be found in Goa. ¬†Very nutritious and according to your diet .  Come and enjoy healthy eating
Its a cafe located in Bootstart hostel in Arambol. The staff is polite and friendly. It is one of the best hostel I have ever stayed. The surrounding is beautiful and peaceful.  We ordered hot n sour soup, masala papad and hakka noodles. Everything was served hot. Soup was good and so was the masala papad. Hakka noodles had too much of vegetables and was little bit oily.  Overall its a good place to eat if you are staying at Bootstart hostel.
The cleanest hostel with beautiful comfortable rooms and HOT showers. The staff are welcoming and friendly and always have a helping hand. Avi creates the best food, the best I‚Äôve had in Goa. This hostel is so cheap for the standard and cleanliness.
What else do you require when you get both stay and amazing food at the very same place. This place, I would say had been one of the best places I have had visited and stayed in Goa. The peaceful surrounding, calming breeze and the awesome service, everything is worth a try at least once. This place is basically a hostel but it also has personal rooms. Special mention would be of the food that they serve which is really tasty and fresh. Specially the chicken cheese grilled sandwich, which is one of my favourites.
If you are in mandrem area of Goa, Kal's Cafe visit is highly recommend.   Top notch ambience and the staff is super respectful. Lot of food options across various cuisines. Lovely and lively atmosphere that just sets the mood right. And evenings are just good. We ordered cheese garlic naans and are left speechless. They are just too yummy. We were skeptical about veg food coz it's Goa and are surprised that they didn't disappoint us. We ordered mix veg Curry, dal and palak paneer and they are cooked to perfection. Not too much oil and not too spicy. We stayed at mandrem and all the 4 days we ended up eating and having a great time at Kals. Super highly recommended.
Recently when we were in Goa, a friend suggested to visit Kals Cafe at Mandrem and we loved the place. The vibes here are so pleasant, soothing music, felt super cozy and Kals is probably the best host so far we came across in Goa.  Food is great and the best part is they customize it as we want which most of the cafes in Goa don't.  We loved the butter garlic fish and butter garlic praws.  Kals Cafe is highly recommended when you‚Äôre in Goa!!
Kal's cafe makes you want to relive good times. Good food, music and ambience and amazing people. That's exactly what you want on a holiday when want to unwind. Full marks to Kal's on a good day!
""
Hidden Place in Mandrem which serves quality food. Music, drinks, perfectly cooked sea food and awesome cappuccino with the warm host. People there, are too good and helpful in nature. We were god damn lucky that our place is just few steps next to this amazing cafe. If you're in goa you must visit this place.
This is a wonderful place. Indian Thali is one I liked the most. Just for Rs 340 and its so filling you can share the Thali with your partner and that's the best part. Food is served piping hot.
If you are a seafood lover then please do visit this restaurant. Almost all the dishes are superb. Do try tandoori prawns Also you will enjoy nice river view.
Relaxed ambience. Can easily spend a lazy afternoon. Nice and breezy. Food was just ok though. Mussels were not fresh which was a let down.
Awesome seafood and a major hangout for people who love from us of food and crave typical Goan preparation... Good place for someone to relax. Crabs are to dye for...
""
Best seafood in goa..love everything about this place.
""
The best goan food... my favourite place since my childhood.. everything is just awesome here... ambience is very simple.. But a must visit when in goa...
If you want to try homemade food,you should try this place.Even though the ambience is not that great and place is small. food quality is good. Specially fish served at this place are great.
Good place to have traditional goan homemade like food. Prawns, xacoti and kingfish are worth trying. Service is also very fast and the ambiance is also good.
Parents n I had been near ponda for visiting the places near by.. v had taken a taxi, we asked the driver to take us for the lunch der so he took us hea... Must seriously thank the driver for taking us hea...the taste, the price is so worth it.. The chicken dry fry is a must try! The pompret fish fry is worth the price.. The only demerit is that v had to wait for a long time for them to serve! Well if u want something good, den v can wait for a bit more time ryt??! üòâ However, the taste is all that matters! So giving 5/5stars

Cafe bhonsle is having a fast service.And also good taste and not much costly. I Give 5/5 star for their punjabi samosa. It is very good cafe. So I prefer you to visit there.
Been going here since childhood. Absolutely love this restaurant. Pocket friendly prices and food is very good in quality as well as quantity.
The Spice farm is a really nice way to spend half a day. Ensure you buy a tour ticket which includes the meal! It starts with the spice tour which lasts half an hour and builds up quite an appetite! The tour ends and the meal starts with a shot of home made fenny! And you can be assured you'll be tasting that fenny for a while! The meal is a buffet of homemade food. The veg options vary and the non veg dishes are between fish fry, chicken xacuti and a fish broth.. So tasty and makes you feel like you're in a goan home with a loving grandmother cooking for you. Definitely recommend going here!
Visiting this spice farm would be very informative and fun filled trip for everyone. The staff over here is very helpful. Attached picture is of cocum drink, served with the buffet. Every food article prepared is prepared with organic spices grown in their very own farm, and hence food over here tastes totally different from which we normally taste.
The all stars are for the place and the repository if the tress that they have  Food here is Authentic Goan cuisines.. they serve both veg and nonveg ! With authentic curries  They offer u Caju Fenny... Try that !
Good food, well maintained farm, knowledgeable staff. The only thing I hate about this place is use of elephants. As I am strongly against the use of animals for any commercial purpose. Everything else here is simply awesome, cool and calm.
very authentic place. nature lover do visit this place. quality and value of food here was good. service here is very systematic. arrangements are quite simple. nice place to visit.
The service is decent with good ambience
I would say it's a decent place, but very unpredictable! I had very poor experience today, the waiter taking my order was totally unprofessional. I asked him how certain dishes are prepared or which sauce they use to toss the items,he gave a careless reply saying all Chinese starters are tossed in sauce! I wondered may be in his imaginary China it happens. Then came the main part, the boy serving spilled items on my jeans and on the floor ( I agree mistakes do happen and the I don't blame the boy) but again the waiter who had taken order turns up and without apologies says mistakes do happen and its normal.  Now coming to food part, Honey sesame chicken was indeed tasty but the Malaysian chicken was disaster. It had very different taste from the start, thought may be it's thier preparation style, but it was proven thanks to filthy odour burbs entire day, indigestion and eventually skipping dinner with anta acids and hydrochloride capsules.  Giving 3 stars to be considerate just for location, cleanliness and of course scope for improvement.
One of my favourite restaurants in Ponda as well as Goa. Prices are a little bit high but the food is worth it. I'm a vegetarian so my favourites here are the paneer biryani and veg crispy. In starters I love their soups. Best place ‚ù§Ô∏è
This restaurant is situated in main Ponda market. Food is ok. Still scope to improve in food. It‚Äôs on 3rd floor. They have Thali also available.
Donot visit this restaurant at all if you wish to spend quality time with good food with your family and friends. The food is below average so are the prices of food which are not at all worthy food service is not upto the mark and the worst part of my experience at this place was we were served late and asked to have the food fast as they were closing at 11.00 pm
""
One of the best in Ponda city. Best place place to celebrate birthdays tooü•≥. Must try their chicken pan fry p.s- only bomeless.
A nice place to enjoy with your family and friends..good food
Restaurant with affordable rates and very friendly staff. Signature dish here is pan fry chicken and it is a must try as it is scrumptious. Overall tasty food with reasonable pricing.
They serve the best pan fried chicken. This place has become a little pricy for the ambience and food they offer. Biryani at this place is nice too. Rates are not updated on Zomato.

Ordered chicken lollipop and biryani. The chicken pieces were stale and chewy. The biryani too sweet in taste. Prices are extortionate. Will not try again.
A nice family restaurant in ponda. Ambience here is great. Service and staff is very friendly. It delivers some lip smacking food which is mouthwatering. Good place for a small birthday party.
Has a decent ambience and decore.Provides bar facility.Has indore as well as outdoor space.Good food at reasonable price.Good service accompanied with mild music.
Ordered chicken tikka here, they served uncooked chicken and when asked for refund the owner hid inside the kitchen. Bad dish plus bad service.
Taste of food and Ambience is good! But they provided light butter chicken not thik.
Recently visited this restaurant in ponda,the place is beautiful and relaxing.For starters, we ordered chicken tikka,maharaja kabab,veg crispy. Main course we ordered chicken fried rice which was nicely cooked. Also tried their special chicken maharaja with butter naan. Squids Rawa fried was crispy. Overall great taste and friendly staff.
Very good ambience, friend staff, reasonably good food, though not very consistent in taste. Mini seafood platter is above average, they had a great paneer dish ( can't remember if it was real dragon paneer or paneer chilli) which all of us loved and asked for a repeat. AC room is a bit congested for a group more than 8. But their lawn/ veranda is a good place for parties.
The Roadhouse serves scrumptious Goan delicacies with a variety of seafood and chicken dishes on your plate. Being located at an ideal location away from the city traffic and hustle, it is a perfect place to spend quality time with your loved ones with great appetizing food and perfect ambience. It also offers an open air venue amid coconut palms and natural flora with ample of parking space. American Steak is a must try here.  Goan Foodoholic Ratings:  Ambience:- 9/10  Service:- 8/10  Presentation:- 8/10  Taste:- 8.5/10  Value for Money:- 6.5/10 #goan_foodoholic

Best Family restaurant.Highly recommend.Best in Ponda area.The ambience and food taste both are amazing and also they have vast menu to choose from.
This was my first visit to this place.. Would always pass by it, so finally made it today.. was a complete disappointment.. We ordered Cheese Garlic Naan, Chicken Crispy, Chicken Tikka Masala and Tandoori Roti.  First came the Garlic Naan within 2 mins of placing the order.. completely cold.. instant disappointment.. the waiter kept claiming they made it fresh.. like I don't what fresh food looked like..  The Chicken Crispy was tasty and so were the Roti.. However, the Chicken Tikka Masala, was horrible.. gravy was good.. the Chicken pieces felt like they were just pre-cooked and frozen in the deep freezer and just tossed in the gravy.. taste was bad.. super hard..  Despite of getting negative reviews about this place I thought of trying it.. But guess all I heard was actually true.. they serve stale food.. Be careful while you visit this place..
I had a great experience here. I was expecting slow service and less quantity of food I ordered as per some reviews but the quantity, service and taste were great. The ambience is A class, the air conditioning was cool and the overall experience was great. I will definitely visit this place again when I'll be around Ponda.
Average food with okay service. Staff is well mannered but the service is quite slow. The only thing I really liked here was their mushroom tandoori. The place is huge so it's quite appropriate for small get togethers or functions. But the food is not that impressive
I would give it a Zero rating. Worst restaurant. This restaurant is very disrespectful. Very disappointed with their service as well as behaviour. They have charged me Rs 600 extra and when enquired they did not bother to attend to my query. Being a Goan this is the treatment what I have got. Will never ever recommend this restaurant ever. 0 Rating.
Ambience is good. Crowded place but dont get carried away by it. Expect a sloppy and slow service. Found an indifferent attitude of the staff.
Nowadays it's more of a hype than the reality. Disappointed with the fish thali. Poor quality of spread. However expensive. Attitude of the guy who was serving was also not polite.
""
The ambience is nice but the quantity of the portion of the food is very small for the price and was suprised to see the garlic bread when ordered .just seems like any goan bread toasted with butter and sprinkled with garlic. The service is very bad
"This is the ONLY place in Goa where I love to eat Mutton Biryani. I usually order for 4 persons and it comes in a nice earthen pot. The moment the lid is cracked open, the aroma just tickles your nose causing you to ""drool"". The rice, the meat is cooked to perfection and every mouthful is a delight, a mouthful of paradise !!! I live around 40kms from this place but it's worth the drive and the crazy traffic. I usually call a day or two in advance to confirm."
Mackerel fry and stuffed was really Good. Food is good and tasty. Sevice is satisfactory.would appreciate if the servers are more friendly.and cordial.
Ambience is nice and food is tasty. Prices are reasonable and tasty food. I love the place. Its in the heart of the city. Aweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
The best part of the restaurant is the ambience. We had chicken muglai, Butter chicken, chicken tandoori & shahi paneer. Food was greatFair quantity and great quality.Had a whole Rawa Fish which was decent in size and tasted good. The Mocktail and Cocktail are awesome, but am totally speech less than the taste of the food, it was really awesome.
Amazing amazing food! Just go and try anything here. In my experience they do great justice to everything they make - from Pastas to Biryanis. Loved their prawns biryani üëç
The place is very good, comfortable seating. and very good food

Ambience 4 star (with great music chart), Food 4 star (had yummy squids rava fry, kingfish masala fry, fish thali, sweet n sour nimbu paani), service 3 star (bit slow). Overall a delightful experience at Vasco Square. A must try food joint !!

Vasco square in the vasco city is all about good food and a great variety of it. They also serve good variety of drinks. The ambience is quite good with an area well lit with natural light. The best part of this restaurant ehich i tried was chicken tikka biryani. I have tried this for the first time and it was much savoury. A must try at this place.

A restaurant to have a quick snacks. I normally go here for lunch and preferably have a veg thali. Normal faluda is not recommended as it needs a huge improvement. Overall 3/5 Ambience 2/5 Food 4/5 Service 3/5
Nice south indian dish made fresh. The dosa, puri and idly are all good here. The ambience isn't that great and service isn't fast. Food is good .
""
Worst service ever seen never ever go
""
This place is excellent for food especially their chole Bhature but the kitchen is not clean at all. We have found hair and small ants in the puri‚Äôs a few times!!!!
The aloo paratha, panneer paratha are scrumptious and good in taste. Best budget friendly hotel. The ambience is not great . The service is quite quick . Best go-to place for parathas.
So this place seems to be elite and nice. Top noche in a corner low market area. The seating is very nice and spacious. The food is just yum and you won't have to burn pockets too. The service is so good. They are very nice and smiling people. Parking can be a small issue else you will get the feel of 5 star restaurant and service. Do visit this place and they got the cleanest washroom is saw in whole goa and near by.

Really good, tasty and hygienic food.

Amazing place, with awesome vibe. I most regular to go place in goa. Amazing food options, very attentive and helpful staff.
Sushi was a pleasant surprise. Thanks üòä
A Quaint Place on the Main road  We visited on 01 Sep 19 for dinner. Ordered only Veg food ‚Äì Hot + Sour Veg Soup, Khao Pad Sapparod, Mushroom Veg Hunan Style with Fresh lime soda.  Ambience ‚Äì We were the only one in the restaurant on a Sunday evening, from order to cheque ! üòä. The place tries hard to resemble a China Town outlet, painting son the wall, large stone Buddha at entrance and pictures on walls,  lantern lights et al. But the best was bamboo music ‚Äì nice soft and non-interrupting. It gelled perfectly with the setting. Perfect for a Dinner-date..!   Food ‚Äì Fabulous !! Well prepared, well presented and well served. It tasted even better on well crafted / presented cutlery, which looked very authentic in pattern breaking shapes. The quantity was very adequate and aroma was appetising. The items contained ingredients as mentioned in the menu. The prologue on menu is worth a read. Though dessert section was disappointing.    Service ‚Äì Our steward was very efficient, concerned, well informed of the items on menu, guided us where required. Had good etiquettes as he served us. Being the only customers (or may be even otherwise), food was served quite well in time. May be the floor manager could have taken time to meet us, but he was missing.  Worth visiting again‚Ä¶!
I ordered prawns #friedrice. order was quick but bitter tasting with hardly any prawns in it. i had to search pieces of prawns in the fried rice. Not upto the mark of hotel HQ and definitely not worth 380‚Çπ
Had a nice dineout with family ,good variety of Food different from the run by mill Chinese , was surprised by sushi and thai dishes¬† ¬†Nice¬† and warm service though there were only two boys, good experience, The portion size was good for more than two people, value for money ,
Extremely slow service. It took 50 mins to get a parcel which had 3 starters only. If we had ordered main course as well I wonder how much longer it would have taken. No bowl meals at all which i think is strange considering this is a Japanese Restaurant. I'm disappointed as they dint even serve sticky rice
Excellent food, great ambience ... paneer tikka and momos r just perfect... great work by setting up this lovely place.... good to hang out with friends .... try grape sheesha .... excellent service ... will surely visit again.
The ambience is very good. You'll have a very good time here. The service is very quick. The staff is very friendly. A Must visit place I must say.  Cheersüçª
Though a quaint hookah place ,barely a soul there ,ordered food but it took forever to come ,chicken momos were ok but seemed recently made not stale ,ambience was quiet and dim lighted
If you have some time to kill before your flight then look no further  Food is beyond imagination even simple things like salads served with main dish were heavenly  Owner is quite courteous so is the staff
Ambience excellent. Service excellent. Food very good. hookah flavours are d best in town should try mix and match. Over all the best place to be if u r a hookah lover. Highly recommended.

Pizza Hut often cheats it's customers.. It charges for a cheese stuffed crust but never send one when ordered on zomato.. Very poor service.. And not expected from a franchise like Pizza hut
""
It was such a great place to hangout and the pizza's look and taste more lively as compared to many other Pizzahut outlets I have been to. The staff are courteous and concerned checking with us now and then if we need anything else. The lighting and the ambience is good. The kitchen looks spotless and well maintained.  But there are a few things that can be improved. 1. The washroom shall be cleaned and kept fresh, probably should install a freshner. 2. The Pepsi is given with too many ice cubes. I seperated them into another glass and surprised to find out that the quantity of ice is equal to or even more than the quantity of Pepsi given. This is the main reason I had to give a 4/5 instead of 5/5. 3. The A/C should have been run at a little lower temperature, it felt hot in there and was quite uncomfortable.  Overall, it was good here. I will definitely visit once again before I leave Goa.
Tried Classic Alfredo, Creamy Mushroom Pasta, Spiced Paneer Pizza, Potato Cruncher. Creamy Mushroom pasta and Potato Cruncher were really delicious. Both Classic Alfredo and Creamy Mushroom Pasta had base as white sauce but latter one's sauce had more flavour. Potato Cruncher consisted of crispy potatoes topped with cheese, mayonnaise and some vegetables. It had a Chaat like flavour. Other two dishes were also good.

Fast service .Great taste.friendly staff.wil visit again.
Tandoori pomfret was yummy.good food. Must try.
Is in the heart of the city. Love the fish thali Seaood is the best! Popular with tourist. Worth the waiting
King fish rawa fry. Yummy foodüòãüòã. Specially the mouth watering thaliüòã

The best place in margao by the roadside . the spicy chicken wingsüå∂, garlic tongue, beef barbeque , prawns fry+ Rawa, chicken gizzard üî• the best we had so farüòãüòã. The desserts were yumm.
The special festive Menu was really not upto the make. The fried chicken was absolutely dry and chunky, pork belly was not really upto the mark only full of Fat. I have been a repeat customer at Peppers but was very disappointed this time. I would give 3 stars only due to the courtesy and hospitality of the staff. The food standard seems like it‚Äôs deteriorating
Everything was super good. Had a beef soup, and their Christmas special for duck and pork. I was simply amazing.
""
Amazing food. Ambience is nice and relaxing. Staff is very kind and polite. Would love to visit again!

Delectable burgers n cocktails..great place to  hangout
This is a gem I discovered in Margao. Parking was a breeze. The place looks bright and beautiful. The seating is comfortable. The ambience is upbeat and it feels so good to unwind here. I ordered Grilled Chicken Steak and Watermelon Cooler. The steak was excellent adequately topped with BBQ sauce and accompanied with potato mash and saut√©ed veggies on the side. The drink was tastefully decorated and tasted wonderful.  All in all a very tasteful and pleasant experience.

Drove for two hours to try Martin's Restaurant and was not disappointed! Warm, friendly ambience and wonderful service. My favourite dishes of the meal were the Goan Grilled Prawns (it had a deliciously addictive piri piri masala), the steak on stone, which is a Martins signature, the smoked salmon and of course, the Sera Dura which was indulgent! The restaurant also has a few Pan Asian items such as Potstickers and Vietnamese Pho, as well as beef steaks which are much loved among the patrons. Don't miss the buttery-velvety mashed potatoes! Will definitely return for more the next time I'm in the area.

Well it was a spontaneous plan to hit this joint and it turned out just as our expectations. I am a big fan of Zomato reviews and I usually take that into consideration while going out for food. Well for starters we had Chicken BBQ and squids batter fry. Well nothing can go wrong with BBQ and some squids batter fry as they were both cooked to perfection. For main course we had stroganoff, two types of steaks and one chicken sizzler . Stroganoff was creamy and juicy and the meat was very tender. Steaks were great too especially the rum glazed steak. Sizzler was awesome too although the chicken piece was quite small as compared to the other ingredients on the sizzler plate. Overall it was a great dinner. Cheers
Had lunch at this centrally located restaurant in Margao. The new menu is interesting, with a good variety of Goan and continental dishes. We enjoyed the food and service.
Best Fruit Salad In Town Good quantity Taste dry fruits woww perfect‚ù§üòç
The nilgiri chicken which was ordered was interesting. Spicy and flavourful, but not of typical masalas. The fish tikka was weird since I was not expecting it in a gravy. Other than that, if you can handle spicy and a bit of oil, this is a good place to try.

Find an authentic goan thali for a reasonable price. Must try kingfish rawa fry. Slow service and friendly staff.  #auntheticgoanthali #kingfishrawafry #seafood
A great place to eat vegetarian food in margao. Very friendly staff and mouth watering paneer dishes. Ginger tea is must have!!!. Overall very pleasant experience.
"The food here is great but recently Tried this place for its Bombay Grill sandwich, i felt it to be very bland. There was nothing special about it to categorise as ""the bombay grill"" it could be as good as normal veggie sandwich also it was not fully grilled. So compared to the taste this sandwich is slightly overpriced. Good For people who like eating light food. Bhuk toh mitne wali hai nahi isseüòÜ"
this restaurant gives a complete north indian taste without compromising. pranthas , daal makhni , snacks¬† everything¬† deserve 5 star .¬† i never had tastier dal makhni anywhere else in goa¬† except bombay spice margao .
If you are a pure vegetarian this is your go to place in south goa. Love their paneer dishes and lacha paratha. Service is a bit too slow but the food is value for money.
#Hygienic #pure_veg #pure_north_indian_flavour, #behaviour of staff and its taste specially chole bhatrue are awsome, a real blended taste of all the spices...

Rice quantity is good

Had ordered crab xec xec and batter fried squids. Squids came in 10mins but the taste wasn't good, it was just dipped in aloo bonda batter seems. Crabs after 30mins when asked the waiter said 5more mins like that we spent another 15mins waiting and finally cancelled the order and went to a new restaurant. The waiter was disinterested in whatever happened and happily he cancelled the order and gave the bill.
We arrived at 3pm, driving all the way from North Goa based on the previous reviews. The washroom facilities were disgusting and unsanitary. The server was least interested in what we wanted and was in a hurry to select something. We ordered 3 king fish special curry with rice, pork sorportel and prawn balchao (suggested by server). The prawn had a strong vinegar taste and was unedible post first bite. Fish curry was boiled fish in coconut water. The only thing edible was the pieces of king fish fry that came with the meal. And their pork specialty tasted like meat bits in water. Bill was 2703. We paid 2710 with out tip based on service levels and walked out. The server was rude as the tip was only 3 rs. and asked us to take it back. The manger had no comments for this. WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. NOT WORTH THE PREVIOUS REVIEWS.
This place is worth visiting as they make some amazing chorizo roll , prawn patties and milk cupcakes. The chicken patties was a bit dry and they serve machine tea. But overall thier Goan snacks were prepared well. Ambience is overall good, service was super quick by Andrew. I'm definitely coming to longuinos to try out other meal options
Amazing and cheap food

Loved the pizza here both times that we visited. We went as families with babies and the pizzas were absolutely delicious. Simple menu, amazing service, and very child-friendly. They don't allow smoking inside and that's a big win for us in Goa. Will definitely go back the next time we visit.
OMG. I just came back from the hospital in Margaon. Some poisoning after bacteria found in cheese. Worst experience in India so far. That too eating at such a famous place.
There is something horribly wrong with cheese. Smelled bad and now I am on toilet pilgrimage. Horrible pizza.Stomach upset since three days.
Gin Fizz is a must have here!
Food was too bad. Even quantity wasn't up to the mark. Everyitem we ordered was pathetic. Staff wasn't polite either.
A beautiful shack at the entrance to the beach. The floor is covered with sand giving you the feel of a beach. One can enjoy the food listening to the waves crashing on the shore. We ordered for French fries, masala papad, masala peanuts, veg crispy fried, hummus with garlic bread and veg hakka noodles. The food is gud here. Will come back next time for their tandoori n grilled items.
This is a sea facing restaurant with a concrete roof. Having said that, there is cane furniture and beach sand on the floor to bring the beach closer to you. We had the tikkas here and were completely taken aback. Apart from the tandoori preparation the plate was also loaded with crispy potato wedges, lemony salad and lip smacking chutney. Everything was perfect...right from the flavours, portion size, variety on plate, fresh ingredients and lastly, pricing. Highly recommended and a must dine restaurant in Palolem!
This place is truly a heave for sea food lovers. They have a wide variety of fresh sea food and they offer customisations ad pet your taste. I tried prawns masala fry and tandoori calamari. They serve this with amazing salad and green mint chutney. Their service is quick and this is a great place to have some beer along with flavourful sea food overlooking the beach.
Went there after being recommended by close friends. It‚Äôs right on the beach. Has a decent ambience Like any other popular shack.   Didn‚Äôt like the food too much. Have had really delicious food in Goa. Especially seafood. Felt the pricing was slightly on the higher side. Staff is impersonal.   Definitely not our first choice at Palolem.
A small cafe situated by the beach side in palolem. This place serves good food
Used to be great. Now they changed their chef and menu and the food is disappointing to say the least

We were here for breakfast on two different days during our 5 day trip. They have a good variety of breakfast options, and their coffee if freshly brewed and tastes great! The ambience is quite noisy. So if you‚Äôre looking for a quiet place for breakfast then this might not be very appealing to you.
Delicious food and courteous staff. All the variety of food is available and each of their dishes is so good that it brings you back all the time. When I am in Palolem, I am not worried about the food as i have the option like The Olive Room.
Go to this place and have a Tandoori Fish. It is a definite MUST TRY. Simply loved the preparation and the taste and it was reasonable as well. We tried a Tuna Tandoori and it was so damn amazing. Tender pieces with the burnt smell of coal, it was just perfect!  It is a must visit when in South Goa near the beach. Kudos!
""
Sea food and Goa are so synchronous to each other that everytime you visit Goa , the sea food keep staring at you for consumption. The Olive Room at Palolem beach just takes care of this requirement. We ordered¬†  1.¬† Crab Masala fry (Rs 800/-) 2.¬† Prawns in butter garlic sauce (Rs 700/-) 3.¬† Dal fry (Rs 130/-) 4.¬† rice (Rs 80/-) 5.¬† And ofcourse some beer and cocktails (Its Goa guys)  The crab was very fresh. The crab masala fry was a real delicacy . Till now I can feel the taste . The prawns did not appear very fresh. Was little disappointed there.¬† Overall a good experience barring the prawns. The service was nice and quick. Total bill was around 2200/- which to my opinion was a good price . A value for money for sure.
Food was decent and acceptable, although with exorbitant prices and took way too long to be served. Host/owner also had an attitude, demanding on the lack of beverage orders. Additionally was charged extra. Not recommended at all. Makes sense why it seems empty even if they have fresh seafood.
""
This place has both indoor and outdoor seating. Quantity is less for the price. Maybe because it's a beach shack.  I had been here with my girl gang we were 4 girls. Beautiful ambience. Every table is nicely decorated with a candle enclosed in glass. Had a lovely time relishing on Goan cuisines in cool breeze near the beach.
Very limited options for vegetarian. I tried Chinese and it was good.. Perfect setup to enjoy the view.

Food is delicious specially Indian food!  The staff were amazing as well!   Amazing location and ambiance  Worth the visit and pocket friendly!!!
Very authentic Goan cuisine. We ordered veg and fish thalis. The fish was fresh and crisp and cooked well. The waiter were hospitable. The food was fresh and homely. The portions were big and good! Must-visit for local Goan seafood cuisine.
In house Restaurant of a beach resort located prominently on Palolem beach facing the ocean. Has an open area seating with full bar facilities.  We had a couple of lunches here in our three day stay at Palolem. Due to its proximity on main beach area, one cannot miss to try this restaurant. Good to have some chilled beers with seafood starters. We liked there fish fries and Fish Xacuti. Service is quite relaxed and even though there may not be to many patrons, the service is lazy. Well for a change we enjoyed it!  Food is okay , drinks are good , don't try cocktails .  Enjoy only for its view towards sea and laze around with a chilled beer in hand.
Located right on the beach of Palolem. A decent restaurant serves generally most of the things you can ask for. Food is good, won't say special but that ok for a beach restaurant. Overall, ambience makes up for what's lacking in the food.
The view from the restaurant is beautiful and the breeze does make for a good open ambience for the restaurant. The food is decent and not great. The serve a great variety of alcohol which is good but yet again the service is pretty sleazy and the staff isn't very responsive. Otherwise a good place to have lunch if on a visit to Palolem.
The best restaurant in paloleam. We stayed in paloleam for 5days. We never missed a single day to visit this restaurant. Food is awesome with perfect price. Staffs are good .. they r also preparing food according to ur taste.. eg. I want maximum tym spicy . So they prepared according to me .. Must try here
Went to this place which is very close to the beach and you will be surprised with the amount of crowd it pulls. The taste of food is quite good. We tried some mocktails and fish kebabs. We also had Crab and Prawn biriyani. Both the biriyanis were quite good. This is place where you can comfortably go around with your family. The people over there are very amicable and courteous. You feel comfortable at this place. Definitely revisiting. Cheers !!
It‚Äôs a fairly decent place to try some Goan food. The Goan thali is good and the fish is fresh. The ambience is alright, but the service is below average.
Butter garlic crabs are simply amazing along with other sea food. Fish curry rice is also a speciality.
""
Loved the Iced tea masala here.Highly recommended.Extremely cosy,homely atmosphere.Did not feel like coming back
Such a lovely place the ambience was great, the food was just exquisite, definitely recommend this to even the staunchest non vegetarians out there. Make sure you try the French Toastie it was sublime. Brownie points for the menu card, impressively hand made.
Amazing vegan food. I am pure pure non-vegetarian but the food here is amazing. Must go place for everyone who visits palolem. We had asain salad, french tostie, mango cheese cake and dark chocolate rose brownie with ice-cream. Loved the soft music as well. To add the menu-card is self sufficient and meticulously written to cover everything in the dish.

Little World has the most soothing ambience with a quirky decor along with a pleasingly handcrafted and handwritten menu card. This cafe serves vegan and vegetarian food. We tried:  Greek Salad - large salad bowl consisting of chopped cucumber, cherry tomatoes, green olives, kalamata olives, feta cheese chunks, basil leaves and olive oil for seasoning.  Greek Sandwich - toppings include creamy feta chunks, avocado(sometimes not available), lettuce, sliced cucumber, cherry tomato, olives, capers, white sesame seeds & basil oregano mayo.  Chana Sandwich -topped with creamy chickpeas, spring onion, cherry tomato, roasted pumpkin seeds served with 'garlic - lemon - not so tasty bittery tahini dip'  Mexican Melt Sandwich - Melted cheddar cheese topped with kidney beans, onions, minced spring onion served with yogurt. (Toppings also include pineapple, avocado, sliced eggplant(Brinjal) baked in paparika powder but only if available with the cafe).  Soul chilling and refreshing watermelon juice is a bliss this summer (No sugar, no ice yet chilled).  #goa #littelworld #cafe

Amazing place. Great ambience and awesome food. We went looking for it after our friend suggested it. The google map doesn‚Äôt give the location properly. It‚Äôs right on the beach and the best way to reach it from the beach and not from the main road (esp at night - it‚Äôs a dark alley).   Had tandoori red snapper and Goan Thali. Food was delicious. The boys serving us were very nice. Had a smile always and recommended foods to us. They had two dogs. Tarzan and Simba. They asked us what kind of music we liked and put some nice English music.   Overall a great experience. The service is slow but then if you‚Äôre in Goa in a beach shack to enjoy the breeze and music, slow is better.   Way way better than the popular seafood joint recommended by everyone !   I think they have changed their name to THE INDIAN now !
The ambience and location of this place is pretty good, and that‚Äôs about all there is to say about it! The food is quite below average- be it their seafood (Butter garlic calamari), Goan cuisine (xacuti and rice), or continental dishes (prawn spaghetti- which was the worst of all!) The only saving grace was the babinca and ice cream we had for desert.  We went by the reviews, and I am not sure what the rave is all about. We were pretty disappointed with the food and what we paid for.
Great ambience. Good food. The prawns is a must try. Polite staff behavior and fresh fish...........
We were searching for north indian food and we found this one. The place is designed in a goan house to give an authentic feel of the culture. Service was bit slow. Food was average according to me but kind of good to fulfilling.
""
A time well spent and luckily we got a very good place. Perfect placefor a family, group party...Live music ads a pleasant ambience......The service was very nice... And food was perfect...Staff was courteous, polite and very helpful.....The setup was beautiful...A great place with a heritage look....
Fantabulous experience here.This was my first time at this awesome place nestled in the heart of Chandor, and boy it was damn good. Right from the ambience, the warmth in the service offered and of course the food was just perfect to the core. The live music was an icing on the cake. Thanks for the awesome service provided......looking forward to another time here next time
A nice and well decorated place in the village of Chandor. Was surprised to know that a fancy place like this existed in Quepem. The place is all nice and lit with beautiful lights and cabana‚Äôs. The food menu is quite vast. The food quantity is good and pocket friendly as well. Even though the place is in the interiors, they did have several guests dinning in. Overall a good experience dinning at Flames!
I just love this place so much..this place has my üß°..The ambience is so good..the service is quick.I went there to celebrate my husband's birthday.we went there around 8.30Pm on Saturday.As park Street is crowded we have to wait for our table..Within 20mins we got our table..we got in on the upper deck..the place is so good&the food is awesome.

Best thing about the place is the DJ and also Krishna proved to be a great steward for all of us.

I visited Barbicue Nation Saltlake like 7 or 8 times as it is nearer to my office premise, but always heard good things about the park street outlet also. So we thought to have a visit to that place on my friend's birthday. The difference I feel that the staffs there specially manager, were very less professional, non polite, non efficient, and a bit rude. We were 30 mins late from the booking time and it was like we were scolded for that and we will not get any seat now. As we were not intended to spoile our plan, we requested multiple times and after that they agreed to give us the same seat but for only 2 hours. We had a coupon from nearby and showed that at the entry time. After manager came and asked us to show the coupon and told it is early bird coupon and as we entered at 1 p.m so it was not valid, though the voupon was a normal one. He asked us to pay extra. After a lot of discussion, he agreed to try the coupons and it was successful. Thanks to them, for spoling the special day and had a bitter experience. I will never visit Park Street Barbicue Nation again.
One of the best dining experiences I have had in a while.. Their buffet is the best
We went for a lunch buffet today. This is my second visit here. The food, ambience and service were great. There was a variety of starters both on the grill and off the grill and they were excellent. The desserts were too good, I loved all of them. Hospitality was great. They even came to the tables for feedback . Overall great experience.

The Awadh Restaurant is one of the most popular dining restaurant in Kolkata, renewed for their Awadhi and Mughlai dishes. We visited there a few days ago and had an amazing experience. The decoration is exquisite, properly reflecting their Awadhi theme, with portraits and replica displays. The staffs are generous and attentive and the service is prompt.  We tried :  1. Murgh Tangri Kabab - chicken leg pieces marinated in exotic spices and cooked. The chicken was tender and juicy. Rating - 4.4/5 ( recommended )  2. Special Mutton Biryani - Classic Mutton Biryani with two soft mutton pieces, and egg and a piece of potato. The amount was also satisfactory. The biryani tasted really flavourful. Rating - 4.5/5 ( recommended )  3. Firni - Perfect classic firni taste. Rating - 4.3/5  4. Shahi Tukra - Tasted good . This was the first time we tried shahi tukra and I found the sweetness a little more. Rating - 4/5  Overall we had a quite pleasant experience .
Firstly the place took a while to locate, but the ambience is cozy for a mughlai joint. We ordered chicken butter masala and biryani. Taste was good. The staff is helpfull. Only portion size of food can be improved. Overall ambience is great.
One of the best mughlai restaurant in kolkata I have tasted. This restaurant offers delicious mughlai cuisines at a reasonable price. It is situated in the park circus area. I tried there Mutton Tunday Kebab, Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Bharta. All the items are extremely delicious. Ambience and staff services of this restaurant is also very good. I will love to visit there again
We ordered Butter Naan, Mutton Dopyazza and for desserts we ordered Firni. Due to the unavailability of Firni, we had to go for shahi tukra, which was not bad. The service was so slow that it deserves just 1 star for it. The Mutton Dopyazza wasn't that great as well, with the Mutton not tender at all. The naan was good as well as the shahi tukra and the ambience. Cheers and Happy Eating! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Tried their speciality, chelo kebabs. The taste was so good, kebabs melted in mouth, the flavour was so rich and creamy. Worth for money. Highly recommendable.
""
The food was good... Chelo kebab is just highlighted but not good at all.... Rest items like biryani nentara , makhani paneer and chicken irani was good
Peter Cat is a well-known restaurant located in Park Street, serving some delicious food items at a reasonable price. Their food items are rich in quality. The ambience is alluring. The staffs are well-mannered and interactive. I tried their Mutton Chelo Kebab and Chicken sizzler. Both the items were very rich in quality and quantity.
Peter Cat is one of the go to places in Park Street. The Chelo Kabab and the Sizzlers are the most recommended dishes in this restaurant. To anybody who is visiting Peter Cat for the first time, I would recommend trying the Sizzler and the Chelo Kabab. Cheers and Happy Eating!‚ù§Ô∏è

When you step into Mocambo, you expect a certain level of quality in terms of food and service. Now, when such an elite restaurant seats you at a table with dirty linen and serves you 'Chicken Imperial' with a piece of steel wool in it, its shocking beyond belief! I'm aghast, especially as the restaurant was involved in a scandal in 2016 with staff condescending enough to not let a woman step in with her driver because he was not properly dressed. The restaurant may have been one of the top places to eat, but with time, the mediocre quality of service is definitely not commensurate with the standard Mocambo gloats. Extremely disappointed!
""
We visited this place after we saw 4.1 rating on zomato but this place is simply worthless. I would suggest everyone not to go here. This place is a waste of money and no good food. Food items we ordered: 1. Chicken reshmi kabab 2. Chicken tikka kabab 3. Tandoori roti 4. Peas polao 5. Plain polao 6. Chicken do-piyaza Taste: The kebabs were not that good as per expectations. Average taste. No chutney or salad were served with the kebabs. Both the plain polao and peas polao were very disgusting. Tandoori roti was fully burned. Chicken do-piyaza was the only item which was good among all these. Quantity: This part is the most horrible one. The quantity was very very less compared to the price. The kebabs were very small in size. And the polao served was too less. Staff: The staffs were very friendly and cooperative. Their behaviour was no doubt very good. That one star is only for those staffs.  Didn't expect this kind of food quality and quantity from such a well known place.
A classy restaurant serving great quality continental cuisines. I have been there twice. On any weekend you can find a bunch of people are standing in a queue in front of the restaurant. It remains that much crowded. I have tested their ala Kiev, chicken steak, chilly fish, a la mocambo and brownie with ice cream. All the items were good but my suggestion will be stick to continental dishes when in mocambo. Specially their heritage dishes are identified on the menu card. Give them a try.

Ordered combo of Butter Chicken and Masala kulcha along with another plate of butter chicken. Loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è Rating 5/5
Such a great delicious foods are available there.i visit the first time here I oreder fish kebab once I eat this it's a such mouthwatering.....Then the butter tandoori chicken items are fantastic...ambiance was too good and staff behaviour was so polite....
One of the best cafe in the town. Ambiance is very nice. They offer both drinks and good food. Dj plays good music. Perfect place to spend your evening. Visit with your friends.
Was here on a Friday and the crowd was great. Had live music till about 12. The staff is great, fun and friendly. Great place to hangout with friends
""
Went here on a Friday for dinner. We tried carribean spiced grilled fish and BBQ chicken. Fresh lime soda and mango mocktail were nice thirst quenchers. The BBQ chicken tasted nice but chicken felt too dry. I didn't particularly like the sauce with the grilled fish. Also the veggies on the side felt raw. The live band performance that night didn't improve our experience either.
Located in Park Street, Hard Rock Cafe itself is a land mark.  As soon as you enter the place you are going to see hard Rock Cafe goodies and once you enter the first floor it's a different world all together.  Loud music but awesome song collections which makes the place so lively.  The staffs are their assets !  Food/Drink service is fast. They have a nice smoking room as well  Cocktails are good . Although I think Sagria could be made better. Food taste is good

Visited this famous restaurant in Park Street on a Saturday Evening, fortunately there wasn't any waiting as two of us were there. The place is dimly lit which gives it a very cozy and good vibes. The Servers and Managers were super nice and the service was prompt. ORDERED 1) CHICKEN FRIED WONTON (4.5/5) 2) DOUBLE FRIED PORK (5/5) 3) MALAI CHICKEN KABAB (4/5) 4) MIXED FRIED RICE (5/5) 5) MIXED CANTONESE NOODLES (4/5) 6) CHILLI CHICKEN (4/5)

We got to sit in balcony which was not supposed to be a sitting area.It was so noisy in small compact place.moreover food was not good.Regret spending time in bad ambience.
""
Go here for an amazing ambiance and even amazing food. Their Baos are top notch and do right by their name. Their Baos are so tasty that I nicked the last one from my girlfriend's plate. We could secure a window facing seat even though we didn't have any booking. The service is fast and the servers are extremely humble. The price is a bit on the higher side but it's worth it comparing their¬† quality and quantity of the food. We tried their Chicken Katsu Bao, Sichuan Chicken Dumpling, Banana Blossom and Chicken Salad and finally ended the meal with a glass of a Sakura! Although we visited in the afternoon I would recommend going here after its dark as the ambiance with their colors and lights comes out more lively.
Well this is my first at Japanese cuisine I am thrilled at the experience. The ambience, decor, helpful staff, view of the Victoria Memorial outside (since the place is on 8th floor and overlooks the monument through full sized glass walls) make up for excellent time to be spent here. The presentation of the food is really nice. In frame: ‚Ä¢ Spicy salmon cream cheese & cucumber sushi roll: This was my first time trying sushi and salmon and I liked it specially with the accompanying dip. However its needs to be tried only by one who is adventurous as it tastes absolutely different for our palate. ‚Ä¢ The patty bao: Soft fluffy bread containing a minced lamb patty with a concoction of sauces. This is highly recommended. ‚Ä¢ Tantanmen: They are known for their soupy noodles. It is highly filling and one bowl is generally sufficient for a meal. This preparation is of pork and is on the spicy side. ‚Ä¢ Fatty hill: Mint centred chocolate pyramid, almond praline, rice krispies and vanilla bean ice-cream. ‚Ä¢ Bora bora cocktail ‚Ä¢ Hoegaarden: What I really liked about this place was that they serve beers in chilled glasses which I am yet to see anywhere else in Kolkata. #FoodHub Join my Facebook group FoodHub for more exciting reviews from me and others.

heard a lot about this place. finally got a chance to order from their place. ordered bbq chicken pizza and chicken french fries from here. pizza was too good and the chicken fries were also so tasty but guess it'll be better trying hot. will order more from this place in future. must try joint for pizza lovers.
So few days back i visited this amazing restaurant with my friends to try out there pizzas and other items. The location is easy to find. It's near VIP bazar bus stop. The ambeince of this place is classy. If your a pizza lover then just don't wait and visit this restaurant ASAP. I'm not a pizza lover but after visiting this place i can say one thing clearly that whenever i'll feel like having pizza, without any second thought i'll head over to this place. Coming to the food we ordered =  1. Chicken Burger. 2. Aussies Fav Chicken Pizza 3. Chicken French Fries 4. Paneer Makhani Pizza 5 Schezwan Chicken Pizza 6. Chicken Pepperoni Pizza 7. Triple Chocolate Sweetzza  All of these items really tasted mind blowing out of which Schezwan Pizza was my fav. Like the spices and everthing, I just loved it. Visit this place and do share your views with me. Thank you! Happy Dining.
So few days ago i visited this place Eagle Bites Pizza, one of the best place for all pizza lovers no doubt. Previously, its was known as Eagle Boys Pizza and at present it is known as Eagle Bites Pizza.  The ambience is super fine, it has A.C arrangements and it can accomodate 20-25 people at a time. The staffs were humble and cooperative.  Coming to the food part,we had:  STARTERS  ‚ñ™Ô∏éChicken French Fries- It was crispy and spicy. ‚ñ™Ô∏éChicken Burger(newly launched)- The chicken patty was very soft and it tasted okayish.  MAINS  We had different types of pizzas, at first we had:  ‚ñ™Ô∏é Paneer Makhani Pizza ‚ñ™Ô∏é Schezwan Chicken Pizza ‚ñ™Ô∏é Chicken Pepperoni Pizza.  All the pizzas tasted extremely good. According to me, paneer makhani pizza and chicken pepperoni pizza were the best. The pizzas had a very soft crust and it was super cheesy.  Lastly,the dessert, Triple Chocolate Sweetza which i liked the most as it was filled with chocolate sauce and choco chips and its crust was super soft.  Overall experience was great(5/5).Do give a try, this place is highly recommended.  Thank You. Happy Dining.

Here's one of the best pizza places in Kolkata without any doubt. Eagle bites Pizza which early was known by Eagle Boys Pizza.  The ambience is quite simple but nice! They have Ac arrangements! And they can accommodate 25 people at once!  So, coming to the food, we had   Chicken French Freis- It was Crispy and that spicy flavour was really tasty.  then we had Chicken Burger- The Burger was okay, not one of the best burgers.  Now come to the Pizza, we had Paneer Makhani Pizza, Schezwan Chicken Pizza and Chicken Pepperoni Pizza- I must say these pizza are one of the best pizza of kolkata. The pizza had a very soft crust and the cheese just melts in mouth. The chicken patty was very nicely cooked. The pizza was very good with all the toppings and the crust of the pizza was perfect.  Lastly the dessert, Triple Chocolate Sweetzza- i liked it very much because it was full of chocolates and i love chocolate.  Had a great experience. This place is highly recommended. Looking forward to my next visits.
Probably the worst biryani I had in my life. Achari kebabs were very salty. The waiter also kept forgetting the table numbers and misplaced all the orders.
""
Due to the puja rush at the time, we went to Shimla Biriyani which was terrible. The biriyani was not up to the mark, not was the naan and the mutton chap. And twice we were given the wrong dishes. The Firni was the only saving grace. All in all a bad experience.
""
Horrible biryani ever had here with burnt aloo and worst chicken pieces even after changing the chicken pieces
Great hospitality management. The signature smoked baby back ribs with bbq sauce was amazing. Appetizers were also good. Decoration, food, ambiance all are quite satisfactory. ‚ô•Ô∏è Thumbs up

I love to come chili's , today Me. Manojit give a wonderful short look like flaming lambergini, and it's too good also food are delicious.. and he help me out for Oder and suggest a good cocktail also... Thank you chili's to make my evening special ..
A first visit to this place surely gave me an encore feeling at the end of dinner and sure enough I'll be back for more.  The food plating and taste were fantastic.  Tried the blackened basa and blackened bhetki in fish, and the lovely onion rings for starters.  Also orders for a chicken fry on waffles. All at quite affordable prices.  Will come back soon.
Visited Chili's outlet at Acropolis mall today... Our server Palash was very prompt and helped us in figuring out exactly what we wanted... D fajita chicken nachos and veg poppers basket was perfect for a session of munching around n gossip. Coming to the main course...the grilled chicken rice bowl is always a safe bet when u want to have a bit of rice n chicken but also feel d crunch...the fajita chicken was equally good but the order that actually took us by surprise was the south Western smoked bacon burger.. With onions rings, bacon and chicken patty inside and dribbling barbecue sauce over it...well it was simply heavenly... For dessert it was the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream...no pics taken as we literally jumped on it...d taste...d feeling...cannot b described in words...it was dat good. Achintya and Palash took good care of us and we would love to visit Chili's again very soon.

I went with my boyfriend during the happy hours and ordered 5drinks and masala french fries and it costed around 1000. Its really very cheap and the ambiance is kinda aesthetic. I loved it‚ù§
Soothing ambience, good music and good pad thai vegetable noddles, could have been better ofcourse. As far as quality of noodles is concerned, I felt they could have been little more softer. For drink I went for Thai Exotica, which I requested without ice, but attention to that statement was not given. The taste of the mocktail could have been better, with a little more concentration on the flavours. I'll go for 3.5/5

The best place to dine out for all those Chinese food lovers out there. The ambiance is so classy specially their live kitchenüòç. The food was of great taste and hygienic too. They have very courteous staff who asked for our recommendations of flavours and tastes. We have ordered:- 1. Thai Chicken Dumplings 2. Toban Chicken Friedrice with Edamame 3. General Tao's Favourite Chicken  Overall I really liked the place and would visit again but the only thing that disappointed me is that as I visited the restaurant during Durga Pujas, I found a drastic difference in their prices of food items but that is even usual with all the restaurants during Pujas but this place actually had a huge price gap with the original prices.
"Asia Kitchen brings to you, a nine course weekday lunch menu- ""Best Of Asia Kitchen"", just at Rs. 545 +GST!  Asia Kitchen by Mainland China is here to present a gastronomic adventure into the streets of Asia and beyond. Located in the 4th floor of Acropolis Mall, this restaurant is known for its authentic Oriental cuisine, Open Live kitchen and amazing hospitality.  The modern and minimalist interiors along with spacious seating arrangements, makes it a perfect place to enjoy your meal with friends or family.  The restaurant constantly refines and modifies it's menu based on customers preference. The ""Best of Asia Kitchen"" is also introduced for similar reasons. Owing to our extremely busy lifestyles, we often try to opt for set meals rather than spending time, deciding about what to order . Also, some of us want to try a variety to dishes on one go, as in a buffet. But Asia Kitchen has thoughtfully introduced a nine course meal instead of the regular old buffet. Most of the items are already set, but you can opt for either veg or non veg options. There are not experimental dishes in this menu, the items featured here are the most popular and bestseller items of Asia Kitchen.  Let's take a look at menu  ‚ñ™Ô∏èGreen papaya and raw mango salad :  The salad features shredded raw papaya and green mango, tossed in an in-house dressing and garnished with cherry tomatoes and cucumbers. It was extremely fresh and a good start to the meal.  ‚ñ™Ô∏è8 treasure soup (veg/ non veg) : I tried the non veg variation. The soup was thick and translucent, and had ample amount of cubed chicken and veggies. It was so comforting on the winter afternoon.  ‚ñ™Ô∏èVeg sui Mai/ Chicken sui Mai  Oriental food is incompleate without dumpings or Sui Mai. Here you can choose between veg or chicken sui mai. The chicken suimai was stuffed heartly and was juicy inside.  ‚ñ™Ô∏èAsian Chilli Fish/ Crackling Spinach  Crackling Spinach is a speciality of Asia Kitchen. Surely an underrated gem in this menu. A mind- blowing preparation of baked and dehydrated spinach, tastes salty with a hint of sweet and pleasantly crunchy.  ‚ñ™Ô∏èChicken Thai Red Curry/ Veg Thai Curry Or, Chilli Basil Fish/ Veg dumpling Chilli Soya  Thai curry is one of the most comforting yet flavourful dishes form the Thai cuisine. The curry was rich and aromatic. It had a mild sweetness owing to the coconut milk used in the dish. It had ample amount of chicken chunks and tasted amazing paired with Steamed rice.  ‚ñ™Ô∏èStir Fried Vegetables  This vegetable stir fry is a blend of colorful veggies cooked in a sweet and savory sauce. It was a filling dish and the vegetables had a nice crunch to them.  ‚ñ™Ô∏èVeg Hakka Noodles/ Steamed Rice/ Veg Lemongrass Fried Rice  I opted for the Veg lemongrass Fried Rice while my friend ordered the smeared rice, to go with the Thai curry. The Fried Rice was elevated to another level by the smart use of amomatic lemongrass in the dish.  ‚ñ™Ô∏èCrispy Honey Noodles Caramel Sponge Cake Vanilla Ice Cream  To end the meal, you get three amazing desserts! Yes, you don't need to choose between this or that, you can try all of the three desserts. The caramel sponge cake was delicious, it was soft and delicate.  If you wish to try this menu, you need to note a few points- Firstly, there was no compromise with the quality of the dishes. All the individual items were of excellent quality.

Kfc being my all time fav quick bite joint. I haved tried almost all the items here. Passing by this outlet thought of trying their newly launched Crispy chicken wrap combo.. that.include s two wraps for just rs 99/- . Its basically crispy Chicken fried strip wrapped with mayo,letus and onion. The wrap texture was very soft and lightly grilled. Tastes good. Also tried their chicken popcorn with chicken longer combo for rs 99/- Nothing to say much about this item,more or less everybody knows about the taste. Lastly tried their Spicy French fries for rs 79/- its basically normal french fries topped with some spicy and non spicy mayos! Good! One thing i found very annoying about this outlet was ,it was not atall crowded,then also they served out food so late...around 15-20 mins..which i haven't faced it in other outlets so far! Even the staffs were very non cooperative. I had to call them 3-4 times for cleaning the tables.  Regards Aritree Sarkar

Good
KFC is amazing, as we all know. Have tried popcorn chicken, zinger burger, crispy chicken in the past. I ordered the rice bowl from here, through Zomato and it was delivered on time. It was hot, fresh and tasty. Sufficient for one person for the price of Rs. 143.
Pathetic experience
I have ordered Chilli chicken from Nightsavior. Food came on time. But Chicken was very stiff & didn't look fresh at all. The dish had no gravy at all. It seems that have ordered a starter.
I had ordered a shezwan rice which was very very spicy.. not satisfied with my order. :(

The pizzas were good in taste but they can improve more
