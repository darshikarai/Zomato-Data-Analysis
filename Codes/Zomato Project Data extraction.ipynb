It's a fancy restaurant with decent furniture and artifacts to enjoy a wonderful meal with friends and family.  The place has a crisp menu with 2 pages in food, and 3 pages in drinks/beverages. The options touch-base all the relevant cuisines, and due to limited choices, the customer doesn't take too much time to order. I've been there a couple of times for lunch, and it was challenging for me to select as there are very few alternatives for vegetarians. I've tried Mixed Vegetable and Coriander Dimsum, and Jalapeno Balls with Homemade Salsa, Cheese Garlic Bread, and Crostinis topped with Cheese and Veggies in starters, Garden Pizza, and Spaghetti Napoli in mains, and Mint Ginger Fizz, and Mocha Frost in drinks.\\xa0  Apart from a few nitty-gritty, I didn't have any complaints about the food, it's delicious. The presentation is eye-catching, the staff is responsive, the service is also quick, the owners are open to taking the feedback, the pricing is proportional to the quantity and the quality, what more do you expect?

Warm welcome with favourite songs and Marathi style welcome by the staff. This restaurant is shifted here last year because of the renewation of the previous place only the distance from 100m.  Ambiance is perfect but space is too small. Not perfect for families because of small place. Cleanliness is good and also the staff is very kind and helpful for choosing the special menu. And also there is open place for dining in the night with perfect lighting and songs. This place is besides the road so if you are dining in the open space you will be little bit disturb it\\'s up to you. Outside kickten is perfect here.  We were hungry so we started directly with main course ......What we had there..  **Main course**  Paneer Tikka:- Perfectly cooked one. Gravy was very tasty because of some different \"Masala\"s the are adding in the gravy. It was littlebit spicy one and addition of green chilli add more taste in paneer. Different taste from different ones. Loved one with perfect taste. Must try recommended one.  DalFry:- Smells good...tasty one... Given perfectly perfection in cooking. Spices used perfectly...Added garlic gives different taste ...Add lemon and taste it.... good taste. go for it.  Tandoor Roti:- Ya it is good but there is not crunchiness in it...As usual it is good but try something different.  Jira Rice:- Good .....Perfection.....Try this with DalFry it gives perfect taste. And also added Jira gives different taste. Good try it.  Perfect restaurant in this area for veg, polite and helpful staff, affordable price, value for money, go for it recommended one for veg.....Must try restaurant...

When we asked bring it one by one the answer was provided as in u r lucky to get the order so fast. And the most disgusting thing was that after the order was given the waiter came with the bill and asked to pay. Now we just started eating and I hope anyone can wait for 15 mins for the customer to finish the food rather give them such an experience.

Once we are settled and ready for order, we picked few items from the menu. Surprisingly, most of the items were unavailable and at last the waiter said that 50% of the menu items are unavailable. My personal opinion is that since pre booking was done, they should have told us earlier that they are facing few challenges, which might us give a chance to switch the place, as this was a professional get together. Then we kind of figured out few items which were available but I can definitely say that vegetarian food was not good at all. We had chilli potato fries, paneer pepper fry, veg exotica sizzler and none of them were uo to the mark. Special mention to sizzler, which was tasteless and no taste of burnt garlic. Non veg food was good apart from Guntur Chilli Chicken, which was required to be changed. I had few more points around mocktails and service, but would like to stop here. :-) No next time for this outlet at least!!\",\n",

However, my reason for this review is that apart from the delicious finger food and a veriety of drinks, HRC Pune also has the most courteous staff. My boyfriend (now hubby) & I visited HRC Pune in 2015 and with the excitement of the above-mentioned proposal, we didn't notice that there was a small mistake in the bill wherein we were charged for drinks that we didn't order. We realised the error, many hours after leaving the premises. On notifying the manager, he displayed utter cooperation and requested us to visit again so they could serve us for the same value as reimbursement wasn't possible.

       " 'Arth, which literally translates to ‘meaning’, makes perfect sense because they have redefined the meaning of food for me. A one of a kind dining experience, Arth encapsulates the essence of all that is Indian cuisine and sets it apart to a whole new bar. You will identify flavors and aromas because it’s not new to our well accustomed palettes, but it’ll still amaze you because they craft it with so much precision and maximize every single detail on your plate.   Their cocktails are definitely NOT run of the mill, in fact they’re very unique and have that added desiness to them. I’d recommend the G Fashioned and Phool-tini to those who’re ready to experiment and jump out of the box. For those who prefer a fruitiness to their drink, Panchgani Sour is your drink! For coffee lovers, give Golden Malabar a shot (it was the table favorite).   Pro tip: Order one to two appetizers with your drinks, they serve a generous helping of poppadums with chutney as complements - which are delish btw.   We started our meal with Stuffed Aloo Tandoori - which was stuffed with raisins, cashews, green apple and a delicious spice mix. For mains, we called for the Beeh Dodah, a Kashmiri delicacy, which is essentially Lotus Stem cooked in aromatic spices served with Jowari roti. This was something different from the ordinary and we enjoyed it thoroughly. Next up was Smoked Paneer with Black Rice Dosa. The Paneer was stuffed and had a subtle Smokey flavoring and the Dosa was simply incredible! Best dish of the day.   We wrapped our meal with the Kesar and Gucchi Pulao - another Kashmiri item on the menu. Gucchi is a type of fungus - very similar to mushroom. The Pulao was the right balance of everything and we couldn’t have enough of it.  All this shared amongst four individuals, for a little over 4000, was completely worth it if not more! Extremely impressed and eager to come back to try their non vegetarian side of things!',\n",

This restaurant served us India street food with molecular gastronomy twist however let first talk about the drinks. #Mango_Colada_Moctail : The creamy mango colada was thick, more like an amrakhand, and set the mood right, waiting for the starters coming up next. #recommended #Virgin_Bloody_Mary : Perfect… a connoisseurs drink! #highlyrecommended #Pav_Bhaji_Bomb : Pavbhaji thickly pureed inside a small bun and topped with cheese. Ment to be eaten in bites sizes and when hot. #outstanding #Mini_Raj_Kachori : it was crisp crunchy on every bite, the Khatta meetha chutney, Chaat stuffings and dahi. Amalgamation was a Stellar! #highlyrecommended #Palak_Patta_Chaat : was an eye catching showmanship of the server. This molecular innovation required the palak patta to be dipped into #liquidnitrogen. Supposed to remove the oil and add crispiness. The pattas were arranged, added various condiments, dahi, mint and tamarind chutneys and garnished with pomegranate and chaat masala. Chaat ready.#Stardish #highlyhighlyrecommended #Misal_Fondue : A very attractive platting , with misal, tarri, bread squares and Farsan. Tasted great. Will be loved by misal lover’s. #Naanza: A soft foldable base, with creamy tomatoes sauce, veggies and overload with cheese. Delightful. Could do with a crisper base though. #recommended #Broccoli_Kalimari : Very soft broccoli with perfect marination. Loved it. Very innovative. #Paneer_Kurchan_Lasagne : A molecular twist to this dhaba style paneer preparation, layered between the pasta sheets. The showmanship of a flambé. It was scrumptious and I helped myself to one more serving. #highlyrecommended #Dal_tadka & Assorted_Roti :Dal tadka was amazing. The assorted naan - Basil naan , jalapeños and olive naan, garlic naan and plain butter naan. Some tweets required for the naans. However very comfy food. #Chocolate_Garden : A fabulous smart dessert with lava cake, ice cream and brownies.

Tried below food and drinks, Cosmopolitan - perfectly blended with vodka, triple sec, cranberry juice and lemon juice The great LIT - stirred with 5 spirits with coke but did not find similar taste of the mixture as the sip had more of a rum spike Shish touk - Chicken was nicely spiced and served with pickeld veggies, hummus, tahini dip and pita bread. That's what we were expecting with shish touk. Chicken was nice but a bit spicy, tahini dip tasting more like a curd...it should have more tahina paste in it, hummus was perfectly blend....loved it, pickled veggies nice and crisped Tomato basil Bruschetta - I asked the server to have our bread nicely toasted like the actual bruschetta while ordering but didn't get it the way though the the topping had a subtle flavour of fresh basil and garlic which was good enough to enjoy it.

The ambience has a very upmarket feel with plush interiors and cozy yet comfortable seating. The staff and the manager were welcoming and very courteous. I went with my parents and was worried if it would be too noisy / loud. It wasn't, in fact the experience was very pleasant. We opted for the unlimited buffet (served on table) and the spread included - Soups, Sushis, Dim Sums, Appetizers, Mains and Desserts with both, veg and non veg options. The Soup and California Rolls (Sushi) was underwhelming to say the least. I have had much better. The mains included steamed rice, garlic noodles and thai chicken in chilly basil sauce. The chicken had a nice Thai flavor with just the right amount of spice added by green and red chillies. Went very well with steamed rice. The show stealers however, were the chicken appetizers (I think it was crispy honey chilly chicken) and the dim sums. Top stuff! The kiwi pastry served as part of the desserts was one of the best I have had in a long time. They also served vanilla ice cream with chocolate brownies which was like every other I have had. All in all I had a delightful experience at GONG. Would love to visit again and try their ala carte spread.\",\n",
       " \"Want to try Sushi or Asian or Thai food? Then this place is the end of your search.  Had been to this place a few days back. I was totally mesmerized with the ambience. They have installed bamboo like structures inside the restaurant to enhance its beauty. During night time, the dim light would give you a soothing atmosphere. They have a very good seating capacity. The staff were courteous and they were very interactive. The service was fast.  Currently Six Course Meal offer is going on which is at just Rs 699/- only. Let's start with the review:  ◾Burnt Ginger Soup: They have both the options for vegetarian and non vegetarian. It had boiled Chicken pieces, lettuce, and other veggies and was served hot.  ◾Spicy Crab Roll: It was non veg sushi. It was perfectly presented. Crab and cucumber were stuffed inside the sushi. It had a sweet taste inside.  ◾Chicken Sui Mai with Spring Onion and Garlic Ginger: These were non veg dumplings. Minced Chicken along with spring onion, ginger, garlic were stuffed inside it. I liked the stuffing a lot. It came with 4 pieces. It was hot and soft. The essence of ginger and garlic complemented its taste really well.  ◾Diced Chicken with Spicy Pepper and Chilli: Diced Chicken pieces were tossed in red chilli sauce. The Chicken was tender and juicy. Crushed black peppers were sprinkled over the dish to enhance its flavor.  Main Course comprised Steamed Rice, Stir Fried Noodle with Beans Sprout, Vegetable Thai Yellow Curry, Chicken with Roasted Chilli Sauce.  I liked the Chicken with Roasted Chilli Sauce a lot. Chicken pieces were tossed in chilli sauce and it was perfectly cooked. It went well with the steamed rice.  At last winded up the meal with some desserts. ◾Orange Zest Darshan with Vanilla Ice Cream: It was honey noodles with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I really enjoyed this.  Overall, It was a pleasant visit. I would like to recommend others to try their six course meal at such an amazing price.

The calm ambience can just set your mood . Had been there for dinner. The dim lighting and the soothing music is what I liked the most. There was a serene aura which created a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy the food. Any meal of the day can be sorted by their ambiance.  I tried their 6 course meal which was for Rs. 699/-. Let's review the food I had in that meal:  ➡ Hot Burnt Ginger Soup - It was the best dish to start with. Soothing consistent soup which had delicious flavours and a lot of veggies including boiled chicken pieces👍  ➡ Chiang Mi Uramaki Roll: It was the Veg Sushi in the 6 course meal. Every component in the sushi added its individual flavour to the dish which made it more lip smacking. It had a nice crunchy taste in its inner part when you have a bite.  ➡ Chicken Siu Mai with Spring Onion and Garlic Ginger - These were the non-veg dumplings and the dips given with them were damn good. The dumpling layer was also thin and also the inner filling was good. Minced chicken with a nice garlic flavour is itself a nice combination.  ➡ Diced Chicken sauced with Spicy Pepper and Chilli - This had chicken pieces tossed with chilli , tomato and other sauces and served with black pepper pieces with it. It was so damn good that the dish was finished within a few mins. The taste was great.  The main course spread included Steamed Rice , Stir Fried Noodles with Beans Sproutand and Vegetable Thai Yellow curry .  Everything was perfect and the Thai curry was scrumptious. It was an authentic Thai curry with ample veggies and consistency in the gravy with the authentic flavours blended to perfection.  ➡ Chocolate Swiss Roll and Orange Zest Darshan with Vanilla ice cream - These were the desserts to wind up the meal. The Swiss roll was soft and tasted nice.  The honey noodles with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream has always been my favorite.  This place is perfect for Asian and Thai cuisine. And this 6 course dinner is the best one to try their menu at a cheap price✌\",\n",

Firstly, instead of lasagna, the bill mentioned Musakka which was priced Rs. 10 higher than Lasagna. I was charged \"VAT & GST\" both being at 5% of the bill amount. As far as my knowledge goes, the total tax (GST for restaurants) is 5%. Here, there was VAT (in spite of no liquor) that too at 5%. Also Note that No GSTIN on bill copy. After reporting this, the restaurant staff seemed confused and hesitant. Finally after showing them that GST should be 5%, I was asked to pay the reduced amount. I demanded a corrected copy of the bill to which I was told that they \\'will whatsapp me\\' and noted my contact. It\\'s been a week and I\\'m yet to get a copy of the same.

       " 'We stopped by at this place for lunch last weekend, while driving back to Pune after visiting Sinhgad Fort. The restaurant is part of ‘Savali Resort’ on the Sinhgad road near Khadkwasla. The place has basic seating and seemed to be clean and hygienic.  The food menu is quite exhaustive with options of Indian, chinese, finger food etc, but\\xa0\\xa0we stuck to Maharashtrian cuisine and ordered the Mutton Thali, Veg Maratha, Khichdi and Pitla Bhakri.  Mutton Thali was good and comes with both the rassas- Pandhra and Tambda , plate of Kharda mutton, 2 big jowar bhakris and a plate of Indrayani rice. Rassas were flavourful, Tambda was spicy but not overpowering. Mutton was tender and juicy, very well spiced but not too hot.\\xa0\\xa0Highly recommended  Veg Maratha was amazing, veg koftas in thick spicy, red gravy.\\xa0\\xa0Again highly recommended. Pitla was mild and went well with freshly made Jowar bhakris and Thecha. Khichdi was average as it seemed like rice and dal had been mixed after being cooked separately.  Good place to have a meal in case you are visiting Singhad, Khadakwasla or Panshet.\\xa0There is a small play area as well to keep little ones busy and ample parking facilities.  A big shout out for Mr Buddhadev who took our order and ensured that service was first class. Dishes are decently priced and overall good value for money.',\n",

On Sundays they have tandoori items. These are outstanding! Absolutely succulent and delicious kebabs and soft melt in the mouth naans.

I have been Visiting this place for a long time now and still there is no change in the taste what so ever. Marrakesh has more than 10 outlets spread across Pune. Its famous place for its non veg and Lebanese food. \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 FOOD \\xa0 \\xa0 Makrana Kebab \\xa0\\xa0 This is their signature kebab this is a must try if you are going to visit it. These are nice Chucky leg pieces of the chicken marinated for a long time with the tandoori spices like the tandoor masala, red chilli powder, ginger garlic paste. This is then barbequed/Charred in the tandoor. The marination is spot on just perfect with the spice and the leg piece are so succulent and tender that you can’t get hands of the kebab. \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 Paneer Makhani \\xa0\\xa0 Being a famous non veg place this place shocked me with the veg offering they gave. This was chucky pieces of paneer which were cooked in a thick gravy made of tomatoes. The gravy had an amazing sautéed flavour to it. To this gravy added some butter to give it a nice buttery taste and hint of garam masala to finish things off. \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 Butter Chicken \\xa0\\xa0 This butter chicken is really a bench mark for me. I really love the butter chicken they serve here. The gravy is tomato based into it they add hint of garam masala and lots of cream and butter. This gives it nice creamy texture to it. to finish off the gravy they add hint of fenugreek powder. The chicken is cooked in tandoor and that’s added to the gravy. The chicken will blast flavours and then you get a creamy after taste of the gravy. \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 VERDICT \\xa0 I have been to NIBM and Magarpatta outlets most of the time and the taste at both the outlets is exactly same. I have heard complains for other outlets but never for these outlets. the food is amazing and you never get disappointed with it.',\n",

I clearly wanted to know whether it would meet my expectations! The only thing that always held me back was the exorbitant price and some of the feedback that raised concerns about the quantity. But having had their Lazeez Murgh Bhuna Biryani, I would say that it was just an average affair unfortunately. It's one of those instances wherein the quality gets masked by the clever marketing and the one of it's kind packaging(which now started getting replicated by other food chains). And as aforementioned, the unconscionable price doesn't help things either. The regular biryani is strictly for one and it comes along with a gulab jamun and salan or mint raitha as per choice. Talking of the latter, didn't get the raitha as per my selection and instead received salan. Minute human errors aside, for the price paid and the quality of food that's received, this is simply an average affair.

Then this chicken is cooked and topped with cheese and bacardi sauce. This is served along potato shaves and beetroot chips. I did got the potato shaves but no beetroot chips. The chicken was not at all fresh. I dont know how many days old the chicken was, it had a oily taste to it which is usually occured after keeping the cooked chicken for days. The sauce was Also microwaved.  Butter Chicken The same chicken story here to. The chicken in the gravy was not at all fresh. It had some oily taste to it. It ruined all the taste of the gravy. The gravy on other hand was good. Had a good tangy creamy taste to it.  VERDICT  Being such a renowned cafe there first PRIORITY should be serving atleast fresh food. The chicken was having serious issues into it. If your pricing so much it's mandatory to serve fresh food. Al thought the service was quick.\",\n",

We started off with some cocktails. The drink menu stocks some of the most premium bottles which also were serving mocktails   Tiki tika - this was blend of standard whiskey and some juices like pineapple, passion fruit syrup and blood orange   Rhode Island ice tea - this was a blend of vodka and cranberry juice. Gives a good nice sober kick   Last not but the least LIT with 5 spirits and cola   Starters :   Penne pinky pasta - this is one of the best pasta I’ve ever had till date in my entire life. The pasta was so tasty that I can’t even express its taste in words. You should really try out this pasta ( highly recommended )   Carribaean chicken strips - I really loved the outter coating of the chicken it was crispy and the chicken was tender and perfectly fried. It was served with orange chutney which was spicy and gave chicken it’s best touch   Main course   Half and half pizza ( angry chicken and panner paprika ) - the pizza was basic it could have been better since the pasta was so amazing our expectations from the pizza were super high.

It was perfect in taste. 2. Garlic parmesan chicken: Grilled chicken fillet encasing garlic, spinach and corn mix on a bed of rositi. Chicken was soft and tender from inside and crispy from outside. Served with tossed veggies consisting of broccoli, bell peppers, zucchini, etc. It was too good in taste. 3. Jamaican chicken tandoori filet burger: Spicy boneless char grilled tandori filet burger. It was so huge that I was unable to eat. Okay in taste. Served with potato wedges. One of the best potato wedges I ever had. Full of spices.  After so much of eating time to drink something. They have variety of option to choose from. 1. Raasta special: As the name says it was special. You just can't miss out on this. It's a tricolour drink. Red at the topped followed by red and green. Perfect blend of sweet and sour taste. Highly Recommended.  Kuch meetha hojae. 1. The Raasta Special: This dessert has my heart. It's not just special it's highly special.

Since then, Di bella have expanded all over the city and they also opened an outlet near my home. This particular outlet in Borivali is a decent sized which can accommodate about 20-25 people at any given moment (indoor and outdoor).  We had the following:  Ferrero Rocher Waffles - Fresh basked waffle topped with nutella and ferrero rocher served with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and a portion of whipped cream. The waffles felt to be a bit overcooked and were hard while the chocolate ice cream had a really funny pungent taste. I've had better ferrero rocher waffles in other outlets of Di bella. Totally disappointed with this one here.  Classic Wonderland - A treat to the eyes but not to the tastebuds. Fresh butter croissant cut from the middle and stuffed with 2 scoops of vanilla and a scoop of the same pungent chocolate ice cream topped with nutella sauce and rainbow pearls. The croissant was too hard to break on the sides as well.

All in all, a nice place to experience buffet spread.\",\n",
       " \"With the amazing decor, mellow lightning, private dining spaces & a vast buffet counter your Weekends are bound to be class apart ✨ . Sigree boasts a huge variety of food especially appetizers & desserts! It is popular for their vast array of barbeque starters ranging from paneer to chicken to grilled pineapples & veggies..

       " \"Only Pune can have a place like this! Every item on the menu was healthy to the core. Couldn't believe such detoxifying food was that delicious as well. Try their Chocolate bubble for sure!  The ambience was just so pretty. The peace one feels in this place is on another level. Loved everything about this place. My absolute absolute favourite!!\",\n",
       " \"I have lost count of how many times I have eaten at Sante spa but I absolutely love love love the place. I am a functional nutritionist, and I follow a whole food plant based gluten free, sugar free, soy and corn free eating pattern.. and it's not very easy to find restaurants that are safe for me to eat at.. Sante spa is my safe haven. A literal gift from the universe.. not only do I get food that want.. I get food that's super delicious. I have not been disappointed even once. Every single dish I've ordered has been a winner!  That's about the food, but what I love most about Sante is their service. Sonal and the rest of her team will do whatever it takes to ensure your visit is joyful. They have customized my orders no matter how weird the requests seem. And they have always delivered everything with a smile. Plus are highly knowledgeable about every dish on the menu.  I love Sante spa 💕💕\",\n",
